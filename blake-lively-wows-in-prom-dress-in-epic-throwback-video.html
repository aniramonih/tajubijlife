Joining her in the footage was none other than her Sisterhood&nbsp;co-star, America Ferrera.&nbsp;</p><p id=eNtUUo7yq5H data-wc=41>"She's on the cheerleading squad, her boyfriend is captain of the football team, and they're both nominated for prom queen and prom king," America shared playfully, adding with a jest, "And she's a movie star to boot. Sooo...you make me sick."</p><p id=eho_hJ0KB1f data-wc=42>The video further showcased Blake’s early fashion preferences. "I love sparkly — anything sparkly," she gushed. Reminiscent of Britney Spears' iconic 2000 MTV Video Music Awards ensemble, Blake flirted with a similar style. However, she eventually chose a salmon pink, sparkle-infused dress.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=ekaUJWGs9aD data-wc=26>&nbsp;"This is the one that when I walked by the door — I gasped," she beamed. The resounding sentiment from fans? Blake was everyone’s favorite girl-next-door.&nbsp;</p><p id=enoOYJLSj4F data-wc=18>Comments poured in, ranging from "She was the moment" to nostalgic remarks about her quintessential 2005 straightened bangs.</p><p id=elBVC19l4_e data-wc=42>Interestingly, Blake's fashion journey didn't end there. In a candid 2019 interview with The Handmaid’s Tale star Sydney Sweeney for InStyle, Blake opened up about her unique fashion choices and the charming ploy she employed when sporting Forever 21 on red carpets.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/88aecee404a3-blake-lively-shallows.jpg><p id=eLlpVwvf2NO data-wc=16><span>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Ryan Reynolds and daughter James make rare joint appearance - and she's so grown up!</a></span></p><p id=eVaaJFsypts data-wc=13><span><span>SEE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Take a look inside Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively's incredible family home</a></span></span></p><p id=eB-96AUYFSK data-wc=37>Instead of revealing the brand, she cheekily referred to it as 'vintage.' She confessed, "I wore Forever 21 much longer than I admitted. I just started saying it was vintage because I was so shamed for it."&nbsp;</p><p id=e2KhJRN9FXn data-wc=29>But behind her fashion choices was a profound self-expression. "For me, fashion is a form of self-expression. It also really takes me out of my comfort zone," Blake shared.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a91d704e6db1-blake-lively-looks-at-ryan-reynolds.jpg><p id=ehxWLPeri_2 data-wc=39>Not many know this, but the dazzling actress admitted to being inherently shy, which led her to the world of acting and the liberating experience of adopting a persona. Even during red carpets, she treated interviews as character portrayals.&nbsp;</p><p id=epkEv9EcgJr data-wc=33>She remarked: "The only way that I feel comfortable doing red carpets and interviews is when I adopt the same thing that I do when I’m acting, which is to play a character."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c86e0da3df06-gettyimages-1395033215.jpg><p id=e0CCtWFdeS9 data-wc=18>Blake's fashion evolution also stemmed from her tenure on Gossip Girl, where she developed close ties with designers.&nbsp;</p><p id=e9C5kuyXdKE data-wc=47>This cultivated her unique approach to self-styling, though she conceded to seeking fashion advice from three very close critics: her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and their two eldest daughters, James, eight, and Inez, six. With a chuckle, the mother-of-four quipped about her daughters’ feedback, "Kids do not filter."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm660tMiopWiblaGyo77IrbBmq6SuuaZ7lGlnbmhpZK%2BtrcqeZKWhppq5unnWqK6sZZmjerG%2BzqZknaqVqMButc1mnKmhk2LBqb7OsJmam5tiw6qwxKhm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
