The actress has been recovering from the flu since Friday, where she felt so ill that she had to pull out of one of the final performances in the city. The Hollywood star is still feeling under the weather, but is glad to be back home in New York, where her daughter Marion, ten, is looking after her. The mother-of-three took to Instagram on Tuesday to share a glimpse inside her bedroom where she was resting. In the snapshot, Sarah's bed was in view, which had a floral duvet cover on it and a thick white blanket. Marion had sweetly given her mum her toy elephant to keep her company too.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=erSJCdr1r0u6 data-wc=5><strong>VIDEO: Celebrities with their twins</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4849293b2dd2-sarah-jessica-parker-bedroom-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eXZeJUEe6MpL data-wc=9><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker shared a glimpse inside her bedroom</strong></p><p id=eOawibsIAyad data-wc=73>In the caption of the photo, Sarah wrote: "Still recovering.

The actress recently opened up about how she keeps her children grounded, despite their parents being in the public eye. Appearing on Australia's KIIS FM, the star said: "Parents who aren't well known can have children who aren't grounded because of the example they set in their home."</p><p id=emWJoWaCnTmX data-wc=79>She went on to explain that since she grew up with not a lot of money, she vowed that after finding fame she would only give her family what they need, rather than what they want. She said she tells her children: "I will do my best to make sure you always have what you need, but I want you pining towards something. I want you to work for something, to dream of it, to will it to happen."</p><p id=epU3qwT9s49K data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
