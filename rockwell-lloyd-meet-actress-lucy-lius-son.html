Shortly after the baby was born, Liu took to Instagram to share a photo of herself tenderly cradling her son. The baby news surprised friends and fans of the renowned actress because she had always kept her private life out of the spotlight.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, almost no one knew about her surrogate’s pregnancy, and her non-traditional road to motherhood was a bombshell. With her little one growing, Liu admits that she loves everything about motherhood. However, fans of the multi-award-winning actress are eager to know more about her son, especially the identity of his father.</p><p>Here’s everything we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-30_03-42-39-fotor-2023103035213.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Is_Lucy_Lius_Son></span>How Old Is Lucy Liu’s Son?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rockwell Lloyd is eight years old. The renowned actress welcomed her son into the world on August 28, 2015, via gestational surrogate. After the stunning actress announced the birth of her son, she suffered a barrage of criticisms.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the stunning actress revealed that she became entranced when she saw Lloyd. Liu also added that it felt like she had taken a love potion during the first few months of motherhood because she was “totally in love.”</p><p>In an interview, Liu attributed her decision to have a child through surrogacy to her hectic work schedule. Despite the criticisms she faced after her son’s birth, Liu has become an advocate for non-traditional families. The stunning actress lends her voice to non-traditional families, from single parents to gay couples and transgender children, appealing to love and understanding above all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-30_03-44-02-fotor-2023103035337.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Lucy_Lius_Sons_Father></span>Who Is Lucy Liu’s Son’s Father?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although Liu announced the birth of her son in an Instagram post, she has yet to reveal the identity of the baby’s father. Consequently, details about the identity of Rockwell Lloyd’s father elude the media. While the “Charlie’s Angels” actress has dated several high-profile men, none made it to the aisle.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this did not deter her dream of becoming a mother one day. Therefore, she chose to walk the surrogacy path and got her son without a boyfriend or a husband to bear the title of Lucy Liu’s son’s father. Nonetheless, the stunning actress is faring well as a single mother.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Rockwell_Lloyds_Mother></span>Who Is Rockwell Lloyd’s Mother?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lucy Liu was born in New York City on December 2, 1968. She is the youngest of three children born to Cecilia, a biochemist, and Tom Liu, a civil engineer who sold digital clock pens. Hence, Liu has an older brother, John, and an older sister, Jenny. Growing up, Liu learned to speak Mandarin at home and began studying English when she was five.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, she studied the martial art “kali-eskrima-silat” as a hobby when she was young. Liu attended Joseph Pulitzer Middle School and graduated from Stuyvesant High School. Afterward, Liu enrolled at New York University. However, she transferred to the University of Michigan, where she was a member of the Chi Omega sorority and studied Asian languages and cultures.</p><p>After earning a degree in Asian Languages and Cultures from the University of Michigan, Rockwell Lloyd’s mother pursued a career in acting. Her breakthrough role came when she appeared as the vicious lawyer Ling Woo in the hit series “Ally McBeal.” As her career blossomed, she landed roles in films like the “Charlie’s Angels” series with Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Liu’s voice acted as Master Viper in the “Kung Fu Panda” franchise (2008-2016) and Silvermist in the “Tinker Bell” series (2008-2014).
