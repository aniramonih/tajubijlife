So, who better than her to “reflect New York City” on the</span><i><span> Real Housewives of New York City </span></i><span>season 14?</span></p><p><span>Get to know this real housewife better as this article proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Sai De Silva On RHONY</b></h3><p><span>In Oct 2022, Bravo revealed its brand-new cast for the rebooted </span><i><span>Real Housewives of New York City</span></i><span> franchise — set to premiere in 2023 — and our star, Sai De Silva was on its list.</span></p><p><span>The cast was first announced at a </span><i><span>Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen </span></i><span>taping during BravoCon, where the ladies also surprised fans by walking on stage.</span></p><p><span>According to its executive producer Andy Cohen, Bravo (this season) was looking for a cast that better reflected New York City. It will follow “an all-new group of seven dynamic women who run in the same social circles, thriving in one of the most diverse and electric cities in the world. From fashion and real estate to philanthropy and social influence, these women have made their mark in NYC and will now share their lives as they juggle careers, family life, and jam-packed social calendars in the city that never sleeps.”</span></p><p><span>Seems like the show will be as interesting as ever.</span></p><p><span>Also, it was rumored that the legacy version of </span><i><span>RHONY</span></i><span> was already fully cast (that included Dorinda Medley and Sonja Morgan), and deals were in the process of closing. However, when asked about the details, Dorinda played coy, “I swear to you, you know as much as we do. I promise you. I’ve heard more about the new girls [on the rebooted ‘RHONY’] than I have about ‘Legacy.’ Listen, if you hear something, call me! I’ll be at Blue Stone Manor waiting, decorating for Halloween.”</span></p><p><span>Joining Sai for the 14th installment of </span><i><span>RHONY</span></i><span> were her co-stars — Ubah Hassan, Erin Lichy, Jenna Lyons, Lizzy Savetsky, Jessel Taank, and Brynn Whitfield.</span></p><p><i><span>RHONY</span></i><span> is produced by Shed Media with Shannon, Lauren Volonakis, and Glenda Cox serving as executive producers.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Sai De Silva?</b></h3><p><span>Sai De Silva was 41 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span>She is one of the older housewives on RHONY season 14.</span></p><p><b>Did you know:</b><span> Sai’s full name is Saiobiyah A Desilva.</span></p><h3><b>Sai De Silva Parents</b></h3><p><span>Sai De Silva’s parents after from different countries. Her father’s Black/Cuban while her mother’s from Puerto Rica + Brazil.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, though Sai’s on good terms with her dad, she has a strained relationship with her mother. Why? Well, Sai’s mother has bipolar disorder and she doesn’t believe it. She didn’t take any medication for a long time, and when she finally did, she medicated herself with alcohol.</span></p><p><span>In simple words, Sai’s mother was an alcoholic. Even when the star tried to help her mother countless times, she never listened.</span></p><p><span>However, though a “strained” relationship, Sai loves her mother. She confessed that she inherited her mother’s holistic genes — which was also why Sai was into adaptogens and things like that.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact: </b><span>Sai has 10 older and 1 smaller sibling. Yes, and she’s number 11.</span></p><h3><b>Is Sai De Silva Still Married?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, Sai De Silva is still married to her husband David Craig (as of 2022).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Sadly, we’ll probably never get to see her David on </span><i><span>RHONY</span></i><span> because Sai once said he doesn’t like to appear on the screen.</span></p><p><span>Looking back, Sai dated David first 8 years before they got married. Infact, they only got married after their second child Rio was born in April 2017. Their first kid London was born on September 6, 2012. And surprisingly, Sai wants to have more. However, Sai’s already in her 40s and she’s working, so, she’s in a dilemma.</span></p><p><span>Now, talking about their courthouse wedding, it took place in Brooklyn. And it was “awful!” According to the star, the person who married them was making up his own words, and she was in her jeans. “I need a do-over,” she said.</span></p><h3><b>Sai De Silva Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>Sai De Silva flaunted a net worth of above $1 million in 2022, all thanks to her career as a Lifestyle and Luxury Fashion Content Creator/ Influencer.</span></p><p><span>So, how did she become an influencer? Well, it all started in May 2014 in Monterian, Canada. She had no friends there whatsoever, so she started writing blogs in hopes to meet other “cool, like-minded moms.” Eventually, people started liking her posts and asked her to do this more often.</span></p><p><span>Then, 9 months later, Sai started interjecting herself more into the blog and even started an Instagram account, where she featured her daughter’s fashion. And one eventful day, Sai’s phone blew up, and she even got 20K followers in an instant. It seems she was featured on BuzzFeed!</span></p><p><span>Thereafter, she gained 100K followers in 24 hrs, and she even was invited to the </span><i><span>Ellen</span></i><span> show.</span></p><p><span>Today, Sai is the Founder and Creative Director of</span><i><span> Scout The City</span></i><span>, the clothing brand, and she’s living the dream. However, not every day is a good day. Sometimes, she feels she doesn’t have privacy anymore.</span></p><p><span>As for her education, Sai attended </span><i><span>Long Island University,</span></i><span> downtown Brooklyn campus to study bio pre-med to become a pediatrician. But she moved to DC, and after failing organic chemistry, she just dropped out.</span></p><h3><b>Sai De Silva Height</b></h3><p><span>Sai De Silva stands tall at a height of 5 feet 4 inches (162 cm).</span></p><p><span>Her distinct features include — her curly hair (sometimes straight), brown eyes, and a fit body.</span></p><p><span>But she shared she wasn’t always this fit because of her laziness. After being tired of being “skinny-fat,” Sai then started going to the gym and hired a trainer.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Sai De Silva From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Sai was born in Los Angeles, California but moved to NY when she was 2 years old.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Sai De Silva On TikTok?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Here’s her TikTok @</span><a href=#><span>scoutthecity</span></a><span>.

Because he liked his privacy. “In a world where we share everything, it’s nice to have something that is private in my life. It keeps my sanity and I also think having a little mystery is fun. However, he is very involved when it comes to his family and I think he should win an award for father of the year,” the star talked about it.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Sai De Silva Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Sai receives her birthday wishes on November 23 and is of the Sagittarius zodiac.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmrJmZYrGmedKio6%2BZXZe2sHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5z5qpnqakqHqztM6nsGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
