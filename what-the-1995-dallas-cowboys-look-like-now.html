He was around for the '92, '93, and '95 Cowboys' Super Bowl wins, and went on to play for the New York Giants and Tampa Bay Buccaneers while establishing himself as a dedicated student of the game. <a href=#>All signs pointed</a> to a future career in coaching, and all signs were right — he got his feet wet as quarterbacks coach of the Dolphins in 2005, rejoined the Cowboys as offensive coordinator in 2007, and took over as head coach in 2010, a position he still retains.</p><p>At least, he does as of this writing.

Realistically, Garrett probably doesn't have much to worry about because when <a href=#>Jerry Jones likes you</a>, he's apparently willing to overlook a lot.
