I’m sending all the love ✨.”</p><p>In the post, Robertson included several sweet snaps alongside her children laughing, touching her bump and holding up the sonogram.</p><p>“Party of five 🥹 There is nobody else I would rather be outnumbered with than you,” she wrote in a <a href=# rel=noopener>subsequent post</a>, tagging her husband.</p><p>Robertson and Preciado, 43, welcomed their first child, <a href=#>son Joaquin</a>, in June 2020. “My guys! So in love over here. Happy Father’s Day,” she wrote via her Instagram Story at the time, alongside photos of Preciado and their baby. The pair went on to welcome <a href=#>daughter Paloma</a> in November 2021.</p><p>Robertson joined <a href=#>Bachelor Nation</a> when she was cast as a contestant on season 16 of The Bachelor, which premiered in January 2012. After Robertson got engaged to lead <a href=#><strong>Ben Flajnik</strong></a> during the March 2012 finale, the pair <a href=#>called it quits</a> that October. She was <a href=#>also linked</a> to <a href=#><strong>Arie Luyendyk Jr.</strong></a>, who was later named the season 22 lead of the ABC reality show. Luyendyk Jr., 42, <a href=#>married runner-up</a> <a href=#><strong>Lauren Burnham</strong></a> in January 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Bachelor-s-Courtney-Robertson-Pregnant-Expecting-3rd-Baby-With-Husband-Humberto-Preciado-062.jpg><p>Us Weekly broke the news in December 2019 that Robertson and Preciado were engaged and <a href=#>expecting their first child.</a></p><p>“There was just a level of comfort and connection that I’ve never felt before. I never believed in that feeling of ‘when you know, you know’ until I met him,” she gushed to Us at the time. “Nor have I been with someone that I so clearly wanted to start a family with.”</p><p>Robertson revealed that she had met her partner eight months prior via Instagram.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He had ‘liked’ a photo of mine on Instagram and I recognized his name. I remember, like, 10 years ago a friend of mine telling me about a guy she liked, Humberto. His name is so unique. I didn’t put it together right away, but I was like, ‘Wait, have we met before?’” she said to Us. “‘This guy is cute. Oh, my gosh, he lives in Arizona.’ I DM’d him and then we went out a couple of days later, and we’ve been together for eight months. He moved in in July, and the rest is history.”</p><p>The pair went on to <a href=#>tie the knot</a> in October 2020 in Sedona, Arizona, four months after they welcomed their first child.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGabmZOdsq270axknKelp8GvsdhmqaialafBtLvNZpinpp%2Bqu6Sx0maqoZ2jYr2zscanmKesXay2tbSMm5ibsV2jvG5%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
