We’ve invested in some nice anti-aging tools as well, like gua shas or microcurrent devices. But could the secret to smooth, youthful skin have been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hiding in our linen closet</a> all along?</p><p><strong>Kris Jenner</strong> knows a thing or two about beauty and skincare, to say the least. When she reveals a favorite product or technique, we’re always all ears — we just couldn’t believe it when she revealed that one of her top beauty hacks was using a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">simple terry washcloth</a>!</p><p><strong>See it! Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Utopia Towels Cotton White Washcloth Set, 24-Pack</a> at&nbsp;Amazon!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Jenner spilled her go-to move for her nightly routine for a story on daughter <strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong>’s site, <a href=# rel=noopener>Poosh</a>: “Wash your face every night using a hot terry cloth washcloth. It acts as a natural exfoliant by loosening dead skin cells, opens up the pores and softens the skin, prepping it for your night treatments.”</p><p>We truly loved to see this simple and affordable advice from someone who has access to the best beauty treatments and products in the world. While Jenner didn’t reveal her go-to brand, we recommend buying a pack of simple washcloths specifically for using on your face. It’s obviously cleanest to use a fresh towel every night, so if you have <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a pack of 24</a>, you’ll be able to go a while before washing them all, and when you do so, you can do it in a batch. They can go straight into the washing machine and dryer too!</p><p><strong>See it! Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Utopia Towels Cotton White Washcloth Set, 24-Pack</a> at&nbsp;Amazon!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>These cloths are made of 100% ring-spun cotton with a terry weave on both sides for that natural exfoliation Jenner spoke about. We love this brand too because the towels have a double-stitched hem, helping to prevent them from fraying so you can use them over and over again.</p><p>Of course, having these towels around could benefit you in more ways than one. Jenner is the ultimate master multitasker, so we think she’d appreciate you finding multiple uses for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these towels</a>, whether to exfoliate your body or to help clean up a spill in the kitchen!</p><p>Apart from white, these Utopia washcloths come in 10 other colors, so if you want to match up with your bathroom color scheme, go take a peek!</p><p><strong>See it!
