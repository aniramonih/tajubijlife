That’s never great when it’s not on your terms.</p><p>“He can be at the top of the game very easily with how much talent he has, so it’s sad to see him not playing, especially given how well he was playing before he got hurt.”</p><p>Pegula has bigger things to worry about right now with the United Cup beginning in Sydney and Perth on December 29, with team USA looking to defend its title.</p><p>She will team up with Taylor Fritz for the tournament before she heads to Adelaide and then Melbourne, where she’s looking to build on three-straight quarter-final appearances at the Australian Open.</p><p>“I definitely like the conditions Down Under and I think it suits my game really well,” she said.</p><p>“It starts all over again with round 1, so we’ll see how that goes.</p><p>“The goal is definitely to go further than last year.</p><p>“It was probably one of the most fun weeks we’ve ever had (at the United Cup).</p><p>“It wasn’t that we didn’t think we’d get along, but I think we got along way more as a group than we ever thought we were going to, and then we played some great tennis.</p><p>“I ended up having an amazing week, and I feel like we carried a lot of that momentum throughout the year, so it was one of the highlights of my year.”</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Melbourne data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Melbourne</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ70qmmq6xfqbKvusisZpyZnmKvpnnArWStoJViwbC8jKidZqyYmnqorcyeZJqinJZ6tbvMpaGapp%2BrtqR50Z6anqGmmsBuv9Spp6iqpGKzs7vMZqOemZSeu6h5056lp6GjYsC1rdFmq56ZnWLCtK2MqKytZaSkeqWxxZ6lnWWlo7a1scNmmq6oXam2tbjEaKWer6NiwLW70bJmbGplm7JyhJBybm6daWuEo33Dbmuda2Fqsaauw21pnZ0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
