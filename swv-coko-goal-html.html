Cheryl “Coko” Gamble, Leanne “LeLee” Lyons, and Tamara “Taj” Johnson made a splash in the music world almost immediately: their 1992 debut album&nbsp;It’s About Time&nbsp;was certified multiplatinum with over 2 million records sold.</p><p id=par-3_41>It’s About Time&nbsp;spawned seven singles including the smashes “Right Here” and “I’m So Into You,” as well as the Billboard Hot 100 number one hit “Weak.” They continued to release hit albums throughout the 1990s before parting ways in 1998.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SWV-WE.jpg><h2 id=h-coko-was-often-the-de-facto-leader-of-swv>Coko was often the de facto leader of SWV</h2><p id=par-4_41>For much of SWV’s lifespan, Coko was considered to be the lead singer of the group.
