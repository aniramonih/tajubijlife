Sun Room Band is a surf rock band from Southern California.</strong></p><p>Like many bands that started in the early 2020s, Sun Room started off as a quarantine project by lead singer Luke Asgian, who was growing more and more interested in music during those still times. While the people he used to play music with in high school stopped, the singer decided it was up to him to dive deeper into the art.</p><p>The rest of the bandmates fell into place one after the other, each with a similar story as Asgian.</p><p>When the world was warning them to start becoming adults, the four instead chose to follow their dreams, and with over half a million monthly listeners on&nbsp;Spotify, the group made the right call.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title=" Sun Room Band Members Names">Sun Room Band Members Names</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Luke Asgian – Lead Vocals & Guitars">Luke Asgian – Lead Vocals & Guitars</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Ashton Minnich – Lead Guitar">Ashton Minnich – Lead Guitar</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title="Max Pinamonti – Bass Guitar">Max Pinamonti – Bass Guitar</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5" href=# title="Gibby Anderson – Drums">Gibby Anderson – Drums</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6" href=# title=" Sun Room Songs, Albums, And Playlists">Sun Room Songs, Albums, And Playlists</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7" href=# title=" Sun Room Tour And Concerts">Sun Room Tour And Concerts</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-8" href=# title=&nbsp;>&nbsp;</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-9" href=# title=" Sun Room Merch">Sun Room Merch</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-10" href=# title=T-Shirts>T-Shirts</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-11" href=# title="Hoodies And Longsleeve">Hoodies And Longsleeve</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-12" href=# title=Miscellaneous>Miscellaneous</a></li></ul><h2 id=sun-room-band-members-name><span class=ez-toc-section id=sun-room-band-members-names></span> Sun Room Band Members Names<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sun Room band members names are <strong>Luke Asgian, Ashton Minnich, Max Pinamonti, and Gibby Anderson</strong>. Each member is from California.</p><p>Each member’s role in the band is as follows:</p><ul><li>Luke Asgian- Lead Vocals & Guitars</li><li>Ashton Minnich – Lead Guitar</li><li>Max Pinamonti – Bass Guitar</li><li>Gibby Anderson – Drums</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=luke-asgian-%e2%80%93-lead-vocals-guitars></span>Luke Asgian – Lead Vocals & Guitars<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Luke Asgian is the frontman and founder of Sun Room. Asgian is <strong>20 years old</strong> and was born on <strong>February 14, 2003</strong>.</p><p>Born and raised in San Diego, Asgian is the genesis of Sun Room as a musical project. The entire band stemmed out of his desire to jump into music and make it a full-time career.</p><p>As such, fans and the other members of the band see him as the creative force alongside the leader of the band. The singer embodies the chill atmosphere the band is known for and reflects the same on his Instagram page where he has over 31.2K followers as of the writing of this article.</p><p>Aside from music, Asgian is very into surfing, which comes as no surprise, and loves spending time on the beach, which is plenty clear to see per his social media. As for music, Luke has stated that he is the Surf Rock lover within the group and the reason why that is their main genre.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=ashton-minnich-%e2%80%93-lead-guitar></span>Ashton Minnich – Lead Guitar<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Ashton Minnich is the lead guitarist of the band. The Sun Room band member age is <strong>19</strong>, and he was born on <strong>September 22, 2003</strong>.</p><p>Like Asgian, Minnich is also from San Diego and was the first member to join the group after it had materialized. According to an article by&nbsp;Atwood Magazine, Minnich’s interest in music, and especially the guitar began at age seven when he received the instrument for his birthday.</p><p>Minnich has been enamored with rock and roll since then and played in various bands throughout high school. As per the same article, the guitarist has been called the metalhead of the group, which puts him in sharp contrast with the rest as they mostly prefer softer types of sounds.</p><p>Still, Minnich brings nothing if not diversity to the group’s sound and is also a driving force in their music. The guitarist’s fierce playing stands in stark contrast with the rest of the group, yet helps in bringing an energy that separates the band from the rest of Californian surf music which can sometimes sound the same.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=max-pinamonti-%e2%80%93-bass-guitar></span>Max Pinamonti – Bass Guitar<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Max Pinamonti is the bassist and part of the rhythm section. The Sun Room band member age is <strong>20</strong> and he was born on<strong> January 1, 2003</strong>.</p><p>Also from San Diego, Pinamonti joined the band alongside Anderson. The bassist knew Asgian from a previous band that the three were in together and jumped at the chance to join the new project.</p><p>Out of the four members, Pinamonti’s musical tastes are the most eclectic as he lives a lot of 70’s classic rock alongside some 80’s new waves. The influence has played a big part in his bass guitar work, which is spacier than the rest of the band, and as such, adds more of a surf element than if he was playing surf music as is.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from his music, Pinamonti has also earned a separate fanbase for his looks, especially his wiry mustache, which has earned him love and derision from the fanbase.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=gibby-anderson-%e2%80%93-drums></span>Gibby Anderson – Drums<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Gibby Anderson as the drummer rounds out the band. The Sun Room band member age is <strong>19</strong> and he was born on <strong>November 30, 2003</strong>.</p><p>Gibby, also known as Gibson, Anderson grew up in San Diego too, however, each member was from a different town within the city. The drummer also goes by Gibby Jones and has not clarified which is his legal name.</p><p>Like the other members of the group, Gibby’s tastes are very particular, and while all of the other guys’ music tastes are rooted in rock music, Gibby has set himself apart by claiming Soul music as his main area of inspiration.</p><p>The drummer’s secret power is that, by using Soul as his main inspiration, his drumming has just the right amount of edge to take the band forward. However, given that the drummer looks entirely opposite to your average Soul drummer, Anderson has amassed his own personal fanbase that is enamored by the dichotomy he brings to the band and its image.</p><h2 id=sun-room-songs-abums-and-playlists><span class=ez-toc-section id=sun-room-songs-albums-and-playlists></span> Sun Room Songs, Albums, And Playlists<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sun Room songs, albums, and playlists have amassed 567,188 monthly followers on Instagram.

The band has been working hard to make up for the lost time.</p><p>Due to being founded during the pandemic, they missed out on touring during their debut years. However, it is to the credit of the band that they have been able to make such a lasting name for themselves despite that early setback.</p><p>Currently, the band has set tour dates and concerts until May 7 on their website.
