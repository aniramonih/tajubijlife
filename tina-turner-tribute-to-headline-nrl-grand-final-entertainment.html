However having it as the main entertainment seems a bit cheap. I bet it cost 10% of what they normally pay,” one NRL fan wrote.</p><p>“Love Tina but this is cheap. I could go down to the the local RSL to watch covers of songs if I needed to. How cheap are they. Embarrassing,” wrote another.</p><p>“The AFL gets Global Superstars, KISS, meanwhile the NRL gets some woman most people have never heard of, banging out covers of Tina Turner,” a third fan wrote.</p><p>“Is that really the best you can do NRL? No wonder the AFL runs rings around the NRL.”</p><p>Sydney Morning Herald’s Chief Sports Writer Andrew Webster fired back at the criticism writing on X: “Why all the hate for Tina The Musical performing at NRL GF?</p><p>“She gave the game its eternal anthem and opened up rugby league to a whole new audience; there was much sadness when she passed away earlier this year. Entirely appropriate she’s being honoured at this year’s decider.”</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>NRL.com journalist Alicia Newton also backed the NRL’s decision: “Those hammering the NRL for Tina Turner musical headlining the GF have clearly not seen it yet. It’s outstanding, the best musical I’ve ever seen, and the perfect season to do it.</p><p>“Ruva Ngwenya (who plays Tina) is an outstanding talent who will light up the stadium.”</p><p>The entertainment line-up on grand final day will also include two performances from Northern Territory rock band King Stingray which performs in English and YolNGu Matha languages.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ70qmmq6xfo7%2Bte9OipZplpKq%2Fr7HRZquroZKqwaZ506hkoZ2RmbmqusRmpaukXZy%2ForrDZp2ippGheqa6056prZmZo7qmutNopZ6vo2LAtbvRsmZybJRqgnKuw59nm51iaIV1rsBtaG9slGaEeoHFbWpwbg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
