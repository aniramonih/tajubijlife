Fellow MGM alumna Debbie Reynolds eventually played the part, to wonderful reviews.</p><p>Kathryn made her non-singing stage debut with 1982's "Night Watch".</p><p>In 1968 she rejoined her Kiss Me Kate (1953) singing co-star, <a href=#>Howard Keel</a> for several highly successful night club appearances in Las Vegas.</p><p>In 1954 Kathryn re-signed with RCA Records and recorded four songs with ex-husband <a href=#>Johnny Johnston</a>. In the next year she made her night club debut at the Sahara in Las Vegas.</p><p>They were Show Boat (1951), where she played "Magnolia", opposite <a href=#>Ava Gardner</a> and Howard Keel; Kiss Me Kate (1953), playing actress "Lilli Vanessi", who portrayed "Katherine" in the movie's "show within a show", a musical version of "The Taming of the Shrew".</p><p>Grayson's most memorable roles came in the early 1950s.</p><p>Mother, with <a href=#>Johnny Johnston</a>, of daughter, Patricia Kathryn Johnston, born on October 7, 1948.</p><p>Kathryn, a coloratura soprano, made her first film in 1941, a "B" picture called Andy Hardy's Private Secretary (1941).</p><p>She soon was cast opposite some of MGM's top musical stars of the 1940s, such as Gene Kelly and Mario Lanza. She was paired with Lanza a few times, but the two never got along due mostly to Lanza's hot temper and alcohol abuse. The pairing of Lanza and Grayson would never match the success of lyrical soprano Jeanette MacDonald and baritone <a href=#>Nelson Eddy</a>, although Kathryn and MacDonald did become great friends. Jeanette became a mentor and an older sister figure for Kathryn.</p><p>In 1939, Sam Katz, the executive in charge of musicals at MGM, sought out a rival to Universal's popular <a href=#>Deanna Durbin</a> and turned to Kathryn. She repeatedly turned him down at the time because she wanted an opera and not a movie career. She finally relented.</p><p>The third child of Charles and Lillian Hedrick, Kathryn was born in North Carolina but grew up in Kirkwood, Missouri, where her family moved in 1927. The entire family sang.</p><p>Kathryn Grayson was born Zelma Kathryn Elisabeth Hedrick in Winston-Salem, NC, on February 9, 1922.
