Mikal acknowledged the rumors but stated that he had no connection to Miles Bridges. He pointed out that, while they had played against each other in college and had a friendly competition, they were not brothers or otherwise related.</span></p><p><span>Miles Bridges also denied that he was related to Mikal Bridges. He expressed appreciation for the comparison, noting that Mikal is a talented player and someone he respected, but emphasized that they were not related in any way. </span><span>While fans may continue with their speculations, it is clear that both players have admitted publicly that they are not brothers or related in any way.</span></p><p>Meanwhile, Mikal took it upon himself to remind everyone not to confuse them in July 2022 after Shannon Sharpe and Skip Bayless made quite a mistake on an episode of the Undisputed. They mistook Miles as the player for the Suns and Mikal for the Hornets. After seeing the hilarious and embarrassing exchange between the two sports analysts, Mikal took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Twitter</a> to call them out.</p><p><span>Although it is certainly quite shocking that Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe made that mistake, this is actually not the first time people have confused the two. There have been other instances where people have thought they are brothers because their names are similar. And not only do they have the same surname, but their first names also start with the same letter.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmmqqVYrqquMSsZJuqmZm0pr%2BMmqWdZZ2euKK4jJupopyXmsBurtGoq6Gdoqh6sL6Mq5ylmaSasXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
