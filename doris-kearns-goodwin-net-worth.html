Some of the books she’s written include “Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln”, and “Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream”. All of her efforts have helped put her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Doris Kearns Goodwin? As of mid-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $10 million, mostly earned through a successful career as a biographer. She also won a Pulitzer Prize for History thanks to her work in “No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II”. All of these achievements have ensured the position of her wealth.</p><h3>Doris Kearns Goodwin Net Worth $10 million</h3><p>Doris attended Colby College and would graduate in 1964 as magna cum laude. In the same year, she was awarded a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship to allow her to pursue doctoral studies, and she then attended Harvard University from where she would graduate with a PhD in government four years later.</p><p>Prior to completing her doctoral studies, Kearns served as a White House Fellow of the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. She was originally intended to be an Oval Office assistant during her internship, but was instead assigned to the Department of Labor, due to her involvement in the anti-Vietnam War movement. She would later become a member of Johnson’s staff and focused on anti-poverty efforts. In 1969, during the end of Johnson’s tenure, Kearns returned to Harvard to teach, and would do so for the next decade. She also started to draft Johnson’s memoirs leading to “Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream” which was released in 1977. It became a New York Times bestseller, launching her writing career and increasing her net worth significantly.</p><p>Doris also worked as a journalist, and was the first female journalist to enter the locker room of the Boston Red Sox. In 1994, she released “No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front During World War II” which would earn a Pulitzer Prize for History the following year. In 2005, she then won the Lincoln Prize thanks to her book “Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln”, which was adapted for a film in 2012 entitled “Lincoln”. Doris also frequently featured on “Meet the Press” and “Charlie Rose”, and additionally was a consultant on the Stephen King novel “11/22/63” which paints a worst case scenario if history changed. A few of her latest endeavors include winning the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Nonfiction for her work in “The Bully Pulpit”, awarded in 2014. She also made an appearance in an episode of “American Horror Story: Roanoke”.</p><p>For her personal life, it is known that in 1975 Kearns married Richard N. Goodwin, who worked for the Johnson and Kennedy Administrations – they have three children and reside in Concord, Massachusetts. She’s been under some criticism alleging of plagiarism, which caused her to resign from “PBS NewsHour” and the Pulitzer Prize Board.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=12.064743589744><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Doris Kearns Goodwin</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 4, 1943</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Brooklyn, New York City, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Biographer</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Colby College, Bates College, Harvard University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Richard N.

I didn't know how deep the friendship was between the two men until I read their almost four hundred letters, stretching back the to early '30s. It made me realize the heartbreak when they ruptured was much more than a political division.</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>2</td><td>Roosevelt coined the phrase 'bully pulpit' for the platform a president has to influence public sentiment. I think after Sandy Hook, when Obama went out and he talked a lot about gun control and met with the parents, there was a sense that something was going to happen. But then, I guess, the power of special interests was greater than public sentiment.</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>3</td><td>Those who knew Lincoln described him as an extraordinarily funny man. Humor was an essential aspect of his temperament. He laughed, he explained, so he did not weep. His 'eyes would sparkle with fun', one old-timer remembered, 'and when he had reached the point in his narrative which invariably invoked the laughter of the crowd, nobody's enjoyment was greater than his'. His ability to counter criticism with humor was legendary. When told that he was two-faced, he instantly responded, 'If I had two faces, do you think I'd be wearing this face?'</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>4</td><td>Although Lincoln's voice was 'thin' and 'high-pitched', reporter Horace White recalled, it had 'much carrying power' and 'could be heard a long distance in spite of the bustle and tumult of the crowd'. While he seemed awkward at first, when he 'hit his stride', White observed, he grew 'very impassioned' and 'seemed transfigured' by the strength of his words.</td></tr><tr readability=14><td>5</td><td>Lincoln's singular way of walking, contemporaries observed, gave the impression his long, gaunt frame needed oiling. He would plod forward in an awkward manner, his hands hanging at his sides or folded, behind his back. His step had no spring, his law partner William Herndon recalled. He lifted his whole foot at once and then thrust it down on the ground rather than landing on his heel. 'His legs', another observer noted, 'seemed to drag from the knees down, like those of a laborer going home after a hard day's work'.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>6</td><td>A lot of times when people are on campaigns, it can be like a movie set.</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=29.580930064888><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Working on book about Abe Lincoln, after public controversy over plagiarism charges [June 2002]</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2</td><td>Concord, Massachusetts; Author and historian [November 2011]</td></tr><tr readability=2.3762376237624><td>3</td><td>Mother of Michael Goodwin and <a href=#>Joseph Kearns Goodwin</a>; Mother-in-law of Victoria Anne Bonney Goodwin;.</td></tr><tr readability=1.3913043478261><td>4</td><td>Former assistant to President <a href=#>Lyndon Johnson</a>.</td></tr><tr readability=4.0094786729858><td>5</td><td>Favorite songs: "Don't Be Cruel" & "Smoke Gets Your Eyes" by <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a>; "Blowing in the Wind" by <a href=#>Peter Yarrow</a>, <a href=#>N.
