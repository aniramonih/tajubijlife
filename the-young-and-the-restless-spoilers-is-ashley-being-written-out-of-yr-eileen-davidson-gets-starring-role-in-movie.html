Is Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson) being written off The Young and the Restless?</p><p>Recent reports indicate that Davidson will be leaving The Young and the Restless&nbsp;to star in a movie that she co-wrote. She will also be an executive producer on the film. Several years ago Davidson wrote a series of mystery novels, one of which has just been optioned to be made into a movie.</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebdirtylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/yr-feb-6-ashley-hates-gloria-2.jpg alt="The Young and the Restless Spoilers: Is Ashley Being Written Out of Y&R - Eileen Davidson Gets Starring Role In Movie" width=500 height=287 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Dial Emmy for Murder, will start production this summer according to <a rel=nofollow href=#>SOD</a>. Eileen Davidson will star in the film as Alexis Peterson, a soap opera actress who solves crime on the side. Dial Emmy for Murder, is one in a series of four books co-written by Davidson. If the film is a success it is highly likely the other books will become movies. The actress has been nominated for a Daytime Emmy three times, winning once in 2014 as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Dramatic Series.</p><p>With Davidson’s already busy schedule filming her second season on Bravo’s The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills it would seem impossible for her to return to Genoa City anytime soon. Currently, Ashley is heavily involved in storylines involving Ravi (Abhi Sinha), Phyllis (Gina Tognoni) and Jack (Peter Bergman) running Jabot.</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebdirtylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/yr-ashley-ravi-hot-5.jpg alt="The Young and the Restless Spoilers: Is Ashley Being Written Out of Y&R - Eileen Davidson Gets Starring Role In Movie" width=500 height=279 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>How will Ashley leave the show? Ravi’s romantic interest in Ashley has continued to grow recently and she has even seemed jealous of the time he is spending with Phyllis. Could a romantic pairing lead to this couple riding off into the sunset together – highly unlikely since head writer Sally Sussman made it clear that Ravi will not be Ashley’s love of her life.</p><p>The rivalry between Jack and Ashley has grown as they butt heads over the direction of Jabot’s future. Could a family falling out mean Ashley leaves the company and town for good? Ashley also was recently very ill with an aneurysm. Could the condition worsen&nbsp;leading to Ashley’s coma?</p><p>Will you miss Ashley Abbott on the Young and the Restless during her absence?
