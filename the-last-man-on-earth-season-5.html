There were many funny people behind the scenes and in front of the camera, but the show never got the ratings Fox needed to keep the idea going. In the years since the show ended, star Cleopatra Coleman has said that the cast and crew still talk to each other regularly. They would probably like to see more shows but are glad it ended well.</p><p>“I get messaged every day about that. People getting to the end and being like, ‘What? WHAT?!'” Coleman told Collider about it.“It’s something that’s been discussed but never in an official capacity. We all still have a group text, we’re all still in touch, and we all still do the happy birthday and dinners every now and then. We love each other dearly. It’s a great group of people, and we just had such a good time. It was like a dream for four years.”</p><p><strong>She compared it to Seinfeld’s ending, saying, “No one wanted it to end, but he wanted it to end on a good note. I mean, it wasn’t really thought out that way, but I think it makes it famous in a way.”</strong></p><p>In the series, a dangerous virus has killed most of the world’s people, leaving Phil Miller (Forte) alone to look for survivors nationwide. He eventually meets Carol Pilbasian (Kristen Schaal), and they both feel like they have to help repopulate the Earth, even though they are always mad at each other at first. The show had four seasons, and January Jones, Jason Sudeikis, Mel Rodriguez, Kristen Wiig, Chris Elliott, and Fred Armisen were some of the actors who were in it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Last-Man-On-Earth-Season-5.jpg><p>Star Forte also said that he was open to the idea of another season but that it didn’t seem likely.</p><p>“That was an enjoyable time. “It was another group of people who mean a lot to me and are like a small family,” Forte told ComicBook.com back in 2021. “Many people who worked on Last Man on Earth went on to work on MacGruber. So it’s just this group of really cool people. Yeah, I never say never… Excuse me, ‘Never, ever say never, ever.'”</p><p>He also said, “That sounds like a lot of fun. I don’t think we’d ever be able to do that, but if we did, I would definitely… You can’t tell.”</p><h2>How does Netflix fit in?</h2><p>But the end of a show on a network doesn’t have to mean the whole program is over. In the past few years, streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon have saved a lot of TV shows. Fans of “Longmire” and “The Killing” were very loyal, and Netflix saved both shows after their original networks canceled them. Even Yahoo! Screen got in on the action when it saved Dan Harmon’s “Community” by giving a 13-episode contract for a final season that would give the characters and the ending to the story.</p><p>So, can the same thing happen with “The Last Man on Earth”? Netflix is the Moby Dick of streaming services, so it would make sense for the company to pick the show since they have a lot of money to pay for production costs. However, Netflix already has many costly original shows and movies in production. Also, there are reports that the show didn’t cost as little to make as people who support a Netflix van think.</p><p>It said Hulu was in talks to cast “The Last Man on Earth,” even though it would only be for a short final season. Sadly, this report was false, and the show still lacks a home. It’s important to note that not every show that the streaming services chose had a good follow-up. Yahoo’s effort to bring back the show “Community” was criticized because the cast and script were changed a lot.</p><h2>The Last Man on Earth:&nbsp;A Look at the Ratings</h2><p>The numbers for The Last Man on Earth have been low to average for the past few seasons, and some new lows were reached this season. In the 18-49 age group, season four averaged a 0.79 rating, and 1.95 million people watched.</p><p>On the other hand, Season three had an average rating of 0.89 in the 18-49 demo and 2.12 million people. Due to low numbers, the show could have been canceled several times over the years. It looks like the numbers were just too low for FOX this time. The actual last episode of the series aired on May 6.</p><p>Jones told the cast, crew, and fans on Instagram and thanked them for their support.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by January Jones (@januaryjones)</a></p><p>Creator/star Forte is out of the country, but in this (hopeful) post, she thanked fans for their support.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by orviv (@orviv)</a></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>At this point, it doesn’t look like Netflix will order “The Last Man on Earth’s” fifth season. If it helps diehard fans who have been waiting so long for this to happen, it’s important to remember that other TV shows that have been “saved” have not always turned out well. If “The Last Man on Earth” had been brought back, the cast and story would have changed, since the show put a lot of effort into its story and characters. Even though the end of the show after season 4 may not be what people wanted, it may be the best thing that could have happened.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><ul><li class=entry-title><a class=p-url title="42 Days Of Darkness Season 2: Is It Renewed Or Canceled Over At Netflix?" href=# rel=bookmark>42 Days Of Darkness Season 2: Is It Renewed Or Canceled Over At Netflix?</a></li><li class=entry-title><a class=p-url title="The 100 Season&nbsp;8 Has Been Officially Canceled At CBS: All You Need To Know!" href=# rel=bookmark>The 100 Season&nbsp;8 Has Been Officially Canceled At CBS: All You Need To Know!</a></li><li class=entry-title><a class=p-url title="Derry Girls Season 4 Cancelled At Netflix: Here’s The Real Reason Why It Was Canceled" href=# rel=bookmark>Derry Girls Season 4 Cancelled At Netflix: Here’s The Real Reason Why It Was Canceled</a></li><li class=entry-title><a class=p-url title="The Sinner Season 5 Cancelled By Usa Network’s : Here Is The Real Reason Why It Was Canceled" href=# rel=bookmark>The Sinner Season 5 Cancelled By Usa Network: Here Is The Real Reason Why It Was Canceled</a></li></ul><h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2><h2><strong>Is there going to be a fifth season of The Last Man on Earth?</strong></h2><p>No</p><h2><strong>Is Last Man on Earth getting a fourth season?</strong></h2><p>The fourth and final season of The Last Man on Earth is an apocalyptic affirmation of friendship, with such joyful chemistry between its ensemble that it will satisfy audiences despite the cliffhanger ending.</p><h2><strong>Is the Last Man on Earth going to return?</strong></h2><p>The Last Man on Earth, despite being created by Saturday Night Live alum Will Forte and The LEGO Movie directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, was not renewed after Season 4.</p><h2><strong>Where can I watch Season 4 of The Last Man on Earth?</strong></h2><p>HULU</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvToZxmpJGowW65wKdkqKZdmq6zwMdmqp6Zo6S7boGO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
