Verizon has a broad reach which makes it one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most demanding companies to work in</a>. It is known to give equal opportunities to its employees.</p><p>When it comes to a felon, it does get challenging for such individuals to secure a job at reputed companies such as Verizon. During the interview process, individuals with a criminal record have to go through their share of struggles, especially during the background check.</p><p>There is one question that revolves in the people’s minds, and that is whether Verizon hires felons or not?</p><h2><span id=1_Does_Verizon_Hire_Felons><code>1</code> Does Verizon Hire Felons?</span></h2><p>There are no official statements that the company officials have released regarding carrying out their hiring, or there is no <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">information about the hiring policy</a>. After digging deeper, by interacting with the former employees, there was sufficient information that was collected.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/does-the-verizon-hire-felon.png alt="does the verizon hire felon" width=800 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It can be said that Verizon is open to hiring felons. Verizon is one of the companies known for giving equal opportunities to employees regardless of caste, region, sex, history, etc. The company has always focused on hiring employees who have the right qualification, skill-set, and passion for joining the company.</p><h2><span id=2_In_The_Past_Has_Verizon_Hired_Felons><code>2</code> In The Past, Has Verizon Hired Felons?</span></h2><p>Verizon has not openly put it on their website or claimed about hiring felons, but in the past, there have been employees who had a criminal history and were still hired by Verizon. From this information, it does look like Verizon hires felons.</p><h2><span id=3_Has_Verizon_Been_Hiring_People_Who_Have_Had_Misdemeanors><code>3</code> Has Verizon Been Hiring People Who Have Had Misdemeanors?</span></h2><p>The answer to the question is yes, Verizon has hired people with Misdemeanors. Felon is one of the shortcomings that could come in between the individual getting hired at Verizon, but there are other aspects, such as Misdemeanor. Verizon, in the past, has hired such employees as well.</p><h2><span id=4_Is_Verizon_Listed_On_The_Ban_the_Box_List><code>4</code> Is Verizon Listed On The Ban the Box List?</span></h2><p>The Ban of the Box Movement is a positive attempt nationwide to push companies to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">keep the criminal records out of the application</a>. This is a crucial step. It helps the individuals who have a criminal record to not face rejections in the job due to their past.</p><p>There are many times that this happened when employees with a criminal record are talented and have the desired skill-set, but due to their past, they get rejected for their dream jobs. This is why there was an initiative to introduce the Ban the Box list, and there are a plethora of companies that are a part of it.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/does-the-verizon-hire-a-felon.png alt="does the verizon hire a felon" width=800 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Another initiative is known as the Fair Chance Business Pledge, which is a very similar initiative to that of the Ban the Box List and has the same motives. The only difference between the Fair Chance Business Pledge and Ban the Box List is that, in the former’s case, the companies voluntarily sign up for the pledge and assure not to discriminate the worthy employees during the hiring policies.</p><p>Unfortunately, Verizon isn’t a part of any of the above two mentioned above. This may sound unfair on behalf of the company, but in reality, there are still <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many reputable companies</a> that are yet to be a part of such initiatives. Even though Verizon isn’t a part of such initiatives, it follows the same ideology of not discriminating against the employees on any grounds.</p><p>Also, in the past, as per the information gathered that is gathered, it can be claimed that Verizon has always proved that it is never a part of discriminating against employees on any grounds, even when the individuals have a criminal record.</p><h2><span id=5_Are_There_Any_Special_Programs_That_Verizon_Is_A_Part_Of_To_Hire_Felons><code>5</code> Are There Any Special Programs That Verizon Is A Part Of To Hire Felons?</span></h2><p>Many companies have various <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">special programs to hire employees</a> of a specific kind, which makes the hiring process more comfortable. No doubt, these programs are a great initiative and one of a kind. The unfortunate part is that such outstanding programs are scarce to be seen.</p><p>It is not a surprise to know that Verizon does not have any such programs in place. This does not justify our claim that it would be impossible for you to get a job as a felon. There are plenty of companies that do not have such special programs in place, still hire felons.</p><h2><span id=6_What_Can_Be_The_Odds_For_A_Felon_To_Get_Hired_At_Verizon><code>6</code> What Can Be The Odds For A Felon To Get Hired At Verizon?</span></h2><p>With the information that has been dig through the sources, it can be said that the odds are high for securing a job for a felon. This is only if the felon is qualified and suits the role perfectly well. There have been various statements from the ex-employees online that give relief to the felons for their odds being pretty good in terms of securing a job at Verizon.</p><p>The hiring process for felons depends on two significant factors. One is the crime and the other is how long ago it happened. If a felon were convicted seven years back, then there would be no signs of the conviction during the background check. Some companies do get very lenient if the record dates back to many years.</p><h2><span id=7_At_Verizon_What_Are_Some_Entry-Level_Jobs><code>7</code> At Verizon, What Are Some Entry-Level Jobs?</span></h2><p>Verizon is a huge company that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">caters to multiple different divisions</a> and offers excellent employment opportunities to the people looking for a job at Verizon. If you are someone who comes along with a technical background, you must apply for the technical team at Verizon. This is because there are multiple openings in the tech department.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/does-verizon-hire-felon.png alt="does verizon hire felon" width=800 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Other than that, there are many entry levels jobs in the customer service department. The employees’ primary duties at the customer service department are to cater to the queries and problems faced by the customers. They also need to keep the customers updated about the new phone and service plans.

The point to note is that not all background checks are the same. It all depends on the state or the country where the employee is located.
