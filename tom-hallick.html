[2007]</p><p>He left "Young and the Restless" in 1978 after winning three Best Actor awards. NBC tempted him away with a lot of money and a development deal for nighttime show. It turned into a nightmare, with a revolving door of executives who didn't get him a nighttime show, and as consolation, they put him on the daytime serial "Days of our Lives", which he hated doing and left.</p><p>He was in the very first scene in the very first episode of "The Young and the Restless" (1973) where a truck driver drops him off. He left the show after five years. However, in 2014, he did a homage to that scene for the show's 40th anniversary, but this time he played the truck driver. He also was one of the hosts of the very first episode of the "Entertainment Tonight" in 1981, but he left after one month. Thus far, he hasn't come back as a host for any of the show's anniversaries.</p><p>His first marriage was to his high school sweetheart, with whom he has a daughter Ashley (born in 1969), but the marriage ended in divorce. His second marriage was to flight attendant Pam Crawford. His third and current marriage is to violinist Yin Jiang.</p><p>Tom Hallick was born on June 13, 1941 in Buffalo, New York, USA.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfqbyueceao6Whk6A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
