Now in my 30s and living alone, I'm fully embracing my inner Monica Geller — a clean and organized apartment brings me joy. But what takes things to the next level is burning a fancy candle that perfectly complements my living room aesthetic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The current candle in question is coincidentally from Geller (aka actress Courteney Cox) herself. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Homecourt's Cece Candle</a> is the Friends star's signature scent, and includes notes of cedarwood smoke, sweet cardamom, cinnamon, carrot seeds and leaves, and white leather. The result is a warm, slightly spicy scent that's relaxing and inviting – it's the perfect candle for fall without being too literal.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Homecourt</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To Shop: </strong>$60; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>homecourt.co</a><br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Homecourt is Cox's line of home-care and cleaning products that work just as well as they smell and look. The actress first thought of the concept for the brand during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. "At first, the smell of Clorox was like, 'Oh, yeah, this feels clean and it's killing all the germs,'" Cox previously told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle</a>. "And then, you're like, 'I don't want to smell Clorox anymore!'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from creating alternative scents to the typical pungent cleaning products, and let's be honest, many candles, the packaging is also incredibly stylish. The Cece Candle comes in a durable, stone colored clay vessel that's designed to be repurposed as a cup or storage container once you've burned through the wick. Not to mention, the design is neutral enough that it compliments a wide range of home decor styles. During a recent press event over Zoom, Cox shared that the interior is intentionally painted black so that you don't see the visible soot on the vessel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cox's iconic Friends character would approve of Homecourt's attention to details, and so do I. Cleaning the soot off a candle vessel always ends up creating a bigger mess, so I appreciate that this candle will look fresh from the first time I light it to the last.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking of lighting candles, Homecourt recommends not burning the candle for more than three hours at a time. However, I once (or twice) accidentally left Cece burning through the night and I didn't have to call the fire department. While I chalk this up to the fact that it's a ceramic vessel and not glass, I don't recommend doing the same – just make use of this information as you will.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I don't have a rent-controlled apartment in the village, so pricey candles aren't always an option (hey, I have cut corners somewhere). However, the elevated scent and aesthetically-pleasing vessel will keep me restocking Homecourt's $60 Cece Candle every time I burn through it.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Splurge</a>&nbsp;is our recurring column dedicated to expensive beauty products that are worth it.
