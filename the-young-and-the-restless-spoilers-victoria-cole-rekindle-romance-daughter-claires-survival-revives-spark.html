Eddie Peck) to the lake house under false pretenses, so he’s part of the insane plot they’ve got going on.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Cole thought Victoria was in some kind of trouble and was willing to drop everything to come check it out.</p><p>That says a lot about how much Cole still cares about his former flame.</p><p>Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) has also been dragging Victoria’s love interests through the mud during some of their recent confrontations.</p><p>Nate, J.T.
