Tammi Menendez was a good-heighted, good-looking, and prosperous <a href=#>business woman</a> when she met Eric.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a documentary released about Tammi entitled ‘Mrs. Menendez’. In 2017, A&E also aired a documentary in 5 chunks with the title ‘The Menendez Murders’ in which Erik recalls and explains the murder and its repercussions.</p><p>Lyle Menendez, who was imprisoned, and his brother Erik after murdering their parents, have been married twice. Lyle Menendez’s wife, Rebecca Sneed Menendez, is an attorney by profession.&nbsp;</p><p>When Lyle first met Sneed, she was working as an editor for a magazine. However, unlike Tammi, Sneed kept mum about her marriage with Lyle.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Erik Menendez’s wife Tammi Menendez?&nbsp;</h2><p>Tammi married Erik in the waiting room of Folsom State Prison on June 12, 1999.</p><p>She later said: “Our wedding cake was a Twinkie. We improvised.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was a wonderful ceremony until I had to leave. That was a very lonely night.”</p><p>She once described her relationship with Erik as “something that I’ve dreamed about for a long time. And it’s just something very special that I never thought that I would ever have.”</p><p>In 2005 she wrote a book called They Said We’d Never Make It – My Life with Erik Menéndez and told Larry King Life that he also “did a lot of editing on the book.”</p><p>Tammi was married once before, but her husband took his own life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How did Erik and Tammi meet?&nbsp;</h2><p>Tammi had watched Erik and Lyle’s first trial on television and began writing to him during their second trial.</p><p>In her book, she wrote: “I couldn’t imagine what he was going through emotionally, but I wanted to let him know that there were people out there who empathized with the awful ordeal he was experiencing.</p><p>“Yes, he and Lyle had done something terrible, and they would certainly be punished for it. But even casual observers of the trial understood the depths of the trouble and abuse in the Menendez home.”</p><p>The couple’s letters turned into phone calls in July of 1997.</p><p>On her first visit in person, she explained she felt “no romantic sparks, no crazy love at first sight, no sexual flashes.”</p><p>However, she described her second meeting as “romantic” as they pretended they were eating filet mignon instead of food from a vending machine.</p><p>After the couple admitted their love, she moved from Minnesota to California to be closer to Erik.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Do Erik and Tammi have children?</h2><p>Erik and Tammi have never had sexual intercourse and have no children.</p><p>In a 2005 interview with People, she said: “Not having sex in my life is difficult, but it’s not a problem for me.&nbsp;</p><p>“I have to be emotionally attached, and I’m emotionally attached to Erik … My family doesn’t understand. When it started to get serious, some of them just threw up their hands.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are Erik and Tammi Manedez still married?</h2><p>Despite constant adversaries, laws, and prison challenges, the two married in the waiting room of Folsom State prison in 1999. It was the second marriage of Tammi with Eric. <strong>Tammi’s first husband was Chuck Saccoman</strong>, who had committed suicide, and they had a daughter together. Tammi was 37, and Erik was 28 when they got married.</p><p>It all started in 1993 when Tammi was watching the first telecasted trial of Lyle and Erik, and she instantaneously felt sorry for them, and out of compassion, she wrote a letter to Erik.&nbsp;</p><p>When Tammi started writing letters to Erik, she was married to Saccoman. Tammi once mentioned in People magazine in 2005 that she never knew if Erik would ever write back to her, but he did, and from there, the relationship started.&nbsp;</p><p>They never met officially until 1997, when she flew to Folsom to meet him in prison. And after almost 21 years of court trials and life’s tribulations, their marriage is still intact.&nbsp;</p><p>They both are committed to doing their unconventional marriage work as the prison does not allow married visits; despite this, they both are happy with their never-ending emotional bond with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Tammi wrote a book in 2005 titled ‘They Said We’d Never Make it: My Life with Erik Menendez’ in which she has explained their relationship and how they are trying to make it work for their good.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How old is Erik Menendez’s daughter?</h2><p>Tammi Menendez’s daughter Talia Menendez is the stepdaughter of Erik, but she calls him her earthly father.&nbsp;</p><p>Taliya was just nine months old when Tammi married Erik. Erik Menendez, daughter’s age is around twenty-two or twenty-three as of today.&nbsp;</p><p>Talia mainly lives with her mother, and according to media reports, they travel 150 miles every weekend to meet Erik. Talia also handles her father’s Instagram account and resides in California along with her mother.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tammi Menendez Net Worth</h2><p>The net worth of Jose, Erik’s father, was worth $14 million when he was murdered by his sons, whose property was to be automatically inherited to both of them. However, the money spent on court trials, and expenses incurred during prison, and other costs have been successfully wasted during their prison time.</p><p>She is not disclosing Tammi Menendez’s income source, net worth, or financial sources. No accurate info about her monthly income is also not told by her. However, before marrying Erik, Tammi was a successful businesswoman and wrote a book that could be a source of income for her.</p><p>Inspirational <a href=#>stories</a> trigger passion and activism in a person that gets no boundary to stop.
