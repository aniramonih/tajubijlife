Her parents met while protesting, which she cites as a background behind her activism. She is of Jewish heritage and grew up near the rural community of Willits, California, where she said she experienced harassment, isolation, and violence, was not allowed to use the school restroom, and was threatened and bullied.</p><p>[quote]At age 13, she transitioned to female, keeping her birth name. She then began her work in advocacy and writing while co-founded the organization Trans Student Educational Resources at age 16. She attended Pitzer College in Claremont from 2013 to 2016, where she graduated early with honors.</p><p>[quote]In early December 2018, Erlick wrote a piece for INTO that called Ariana Grande's song "Thank U, Next" "virulently anti-queer" and "transmisogynistic". The piece was met with backlash, after which INTO editor-in-chief Zach Stafford said the piece "should never have been published" and "did not meet the editorial guidelines we created." After investigating the piece, and considering previous allegations against Erlick, INTO cut ties with her.</p><p>[quote]Erlick and a group of transgender activists erected a bronze sculpture of activist Marsha P. Johnson in 2021 in Christopher Park. The sculpture was not authorized by New York City Parks but later received a use permit, making it the first sculpture of a transgender person in New York City. The sculpture received positive reviews from art commentators, citing the criticism of George Segal's Stonewall National Monument for "whitewashing" the Stonewall Riots. The New York City Mayor's office announced plans for a statue of Johnson and her collaborator, Sylvia Rivera, in 2019. The statues never came to fruition.</p><p>[quote]In August 2022, conservatives, including Matt Walsh and Blaire White, criticized Erlick for detailing a plan on social media for private individuals to send spare hormone therapy prescriptions to people in those U.S. states which are working to criminalize such drugs, despite the law only allowing such drugs to be prescribed by a physician. Erlick defended herself from criticism, saying that "all trans people should have access to gender-affirming care".</p><p>[quote] In 2016, Teen Vogue named Erlick a "New Face of Feminism" as a "young feminist changing the game".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3TmqOorZ6csm%2BvzqZmraCimq6le5JqbGtpaWaGbq3NqKuhnaJiwbOtzaewZqiimrGiwM6rZKitpJqxbrHLomSeqpyesKw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
