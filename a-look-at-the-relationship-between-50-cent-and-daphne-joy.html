Her father was born in Puerto Rico, while her mother was born in the Philippines, hence she has Filipino and Puerto Rican ancestry.</p><p>She started modeling swimsuits for OMG Miami Swimwear and has since introduced the “Daphne Joy for Abyss” Christmas collection by Abby Collection.</p><p>At the age of 17, Daphne Joy began her modeling career. Since then, she has walked the runway for well-known fashion houses and appeared in advertisements.

According to Joy, Curtis allegedly caused $7,100 worth of property damage.</p><p>Curtis was promptly detained and accused of mischief and domestic abuse. However, after he entered a not-guilty plea to petty mischief, the charges were dropped. Joy had previously been linked to reality star Rob Kardashian for a brief while in 2013, and during 2015 and 2016, it appears that she dated musician Jason Derulo.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></strong></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Sara Echeagaray</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Zara Larrson</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVflnqtu86kZJqsXam1pnnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkm52krLKmuoxuZ2ablaPBbq3NnWSdmaCdu6Z5yaiwaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
