Y2K fashion is trending, and we’re feeling déjà vu watching familiar fads make a comeback. Not all looks from the early aughts still appeal to Us, but we’re welcoming back one style with open arms — <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ugg boots</a>. Once we originally discovered these super soft shoes, we never took them off our feet. We saw <strong>Paris Hilton</strong> wearing a pair of Ugg boots, so we bought a pair of Ugg boots (and yes, that was a Mean Girls reference).</p><p>Ugg boots are officially back and better than ever! Just this week, actress <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Mila Kunis </strong></a>rocked some <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">classic chestnut Ugg boots</a> in Los Angeles, proving that these cozy shoes work in any climate. Some things never change — now that we know the That ‘70s Show alum owns Uggs, we need a pair for ourselves. They’re oh-so-cozy and easy to slip on and off! Perfect for errands, school pick-ups and everything in between. Score Kunis’ exact boots from Zappos before they sell out!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/chestnut-ugg-boots.png><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ugg Classic Short II</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$170</a> at Zappos!</strong></p><p>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ugg Classic Short II</a> is the iconic Ugg style — the simple silhouette is both trendy and timeless. This celebrity cult-favorite shoe is a closet staple. Crafted with Ugg’s signature sheepskin lining, these mid-calf suede boots provide maximum softness and comfort. They’re like a warm hug for your feet! Plus, the pull-on accessibility is ideal when you’re on the go. These Ugg boots are water and stain repellent, and the durable outsole adds cushioning and traction. Available in 10 solid colors, this fuzzy footwear is a major must-have!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pink-ugg-boot.png><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ugg Classic Short II</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$170</a> at Zappos!</strong></p><p>With over 12,000 five-star reviews on Zappos, this <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">classic UGG boot</a> is a crowd-pleaser! One shopper even called it “the perfect winter boot”! Another customer gushed, “Love Love Love them! So comfy! My favorite thing to put on my feet.” And according to one review, “I can wear these with anything, from leggings to jeans, cropped or full length, and they still look great. They keep my feet so warm, but never too hot like some boots. I could seriously wear these boots all day, every day and my feet would never hurt. LOVE MY UGGS!!”</p><p>So, how do you style these suede shoes? Glad you asked. One of the many benefits of Ugg boots is versatility — this everyday essential goes with virtually any outfit. For an easy ensemble, team this footwear with leggings and an oversized sweatshirt. You can also pair these boots with a workout set, particularly if you’re headed to yoga or Pilates and don’t need sneakers. We also love wearing our Uggs with skinny jeans and a sweater when we’re catching up with friends on a chilly day.
