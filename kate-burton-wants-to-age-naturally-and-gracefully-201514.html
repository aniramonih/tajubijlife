Actress <strong>Kate Burton</strong>, who costars on DirecTV’s crime drama Full Circle, told <strong>Us Weekly</strong> at the premiere of her new show that she has never gone under the knife to look younger because she’s happy to embrace her own age.</p><p>“My whole attitude is you do what you feel comfortable with. I don’t think plastic surgery will ever be a part of my life,” she confessed at the season 2 premiere in West Hollywood on March 16. “Little tiny other things, maybe, but <strong>Frances McDormand </strong>is one of my dear friends and I think we both agree that we want to try to age naturally and gracefully.”</p><p>That’s why Burton has loved working on Full Circle, in which she plays an FBI agent working alongside Will & Grace‘s <strong>Eric McCormack</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“The writing is wonderful and here I am, 57 years old getting an incredible part that they’ve written for me brilliantly,” she dished. “What more can I ask for as an actress? What’s exciting for actresses of my age is that there are so many interesting characters for us to play. And I know that <strong>Allison Janney</strong> would agree with me, and <strong>Margo Martindale</strong>. <strong>Glenn Close</strong>. There are wonderful wonderful roles for women. It’s so thrilling!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean Burton, who also costars on ABC’s Scandal, doesn’t have a few skincare secrets to keep her looking so young. “I really try to take care of myself,” she revealed. “I go to <strong>Kate Somerville</strong>, which is a wonderful skin treatment place. You have to just keep looking for the horizon and don’t get weighed down. I’ve gotten very lucky to have always been able to get these fantastic parts and play my age — a little bit younger, a little bit older. It’s all good.”</p><p>Full Circle airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on DirecTV’s Audience Network.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKarJVir7a%2B06ilZq%2BRo8G0edOoZJqflWK7osDUq5ilpKlirq%2BwjKCpmpuVm8KtuNhmaWlpZWaBcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
