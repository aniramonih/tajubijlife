While <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>rumors have been circulating all over social media</a> the last few weeks, Middleton and her husband, Prince William, are "trying to keep things as normal as possible."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Amid reports from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Sunday Times</a> that Middleton would not be making her return to royal duties until after Easter (likely around April 17), <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>The Telegraph</a> alleged that the princess has not yet "ruled out" the possibility of joining her family on their annual walk to St. George’s Chapel on Easter (March 31). A source added that there has been "no confirmation either way" if Middleton plans to join in on the yearly tradition.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to The Sunday Times, however, Middleton's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>return to the spotlight could be even later</a> than we had initially believed. Middleton's first official appearance may not happen until April 17, which is when she and Prince William's three kids — Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis — go back to school following their Easter break. The palace's original statement regarding Middleton's recovery noted that the princess was expected to lay low until after Easter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Elsewhere in The Times story, insiders and friends suggested that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Middleton would eventually open up about everything</a>, but that it would happen on her own time. “They are at their most open when out interacting with members of the public and I can see a world in which the princess might discuss her recovery out on engagements," a source told the outlet. "If she was going to do it, that’s how she would do it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Middleton's first appearance back has yet to be revealed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLiiwMRmpKKclKGytbvNZpmeraSeerS4xJ6nZp2cnsWqvoysmKWd</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
