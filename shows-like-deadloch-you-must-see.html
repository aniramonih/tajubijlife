The plot follows Senior Sergeant Dulcie Collins and Detective Eddie Redcliffe on an investigation following a series of murders. On a mission to locate the serial killer claiming men as their victims, Dulcie and Eddie find themselves amidst a number of hilariously awkward situations. Without invoking comedy on the <a href=#>crime</a>, Amazon Prime’s ‘Deadloch’ follows the events that skew the investigation into a spiral.</p><p>The show is created by Kate McCartney and Kate McLennan and features Kate Box and Madeleine Sami as the titular leads. Despite delving into wokeism, gentrification and even murder, ‘Deadloch’ manages to merge each element with comedy flawlessly. So, if you’re also equally hooked on the <a href=#>mystery drama</a>, we have collated a list of shows like ‘Deadloch’ for you to watch.</p><h2 style=text-align:center>8. Mapleworth Murders (2020)</h2><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=726273 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/shows-like-deadloch-you-must-see/image-w1280-1-39/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-w1280-1.webp data-orig-size=1280,720 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="image-w1280 (1)" data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-w1280-1.webp?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-w1280-1.webp?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-w1280-1.webp alt width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Yet another quest for truth, ‘Mapleworth Murders’ follows the story of Abigail Mapleworth, a saucy murder mystery writer who teams up with her niece in the small town of New Woodstream to solve homicides. Similar to the quaint town of ‘Deadloch’ in Tanzania, New Woodstream also becomes an unlikely site of mysterious occurrences with no answers. Created by Paula Pell and John Lutz, who also star in the show, ‘Mapleworth Murders’ follows the dynamic duo trying to uncover hidden secrets and find the perpetrators at fault. So, if you enjoyed the satirical whodunit in ‘Deadloch’ then you’ll find ‘Mapleworth Murders’ equally livening.</p><h2 style=text-align:center>7. The Good Cop (2018)</h2><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=726274 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/shows-like-deadloch-you-must-see/1__jhgxxsbdz06sfzho0mwuq/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1__JHGXXSbDZ06SFzHo0MwUQ.jpg data-orig-size=1000,562 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"Michele K Short\/Netflix","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1"}' data-image-title=1__JHGXXSbDZ06SFzHo0MwUQ data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1__JHGXXSbDZ06SFzHo0MwUQ.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1__JHGXXSbDZ06SFzHo0MwUQ.jpg?w=1000" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1__JHGXXSbDZ06SFzHo0MwUQ.jpg alt width=1000 height=562 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Like Dulcie and Eddie, whose investigating techniques differ completely, Tony Caruso Jr. and Tony Caruso Sr. also exist on opposite ends of the spectrum. After serving seven years in prison for a corruption conviction, ex-cop Tony Caruso Sr. decides to use his knowledge and experience for all the wrong reasons. Naturally, his father’s frenzied yearnings mean trouble for Tony Caruso Jr., whose obsessively true nature keeps him going above and beyond to keep his dad in check.</p><p>Created by Andy Breckman, the series features Tony Danza, Josh Groban, Monica Barbaro, and Isiah Whitlock Jr. Much like Dulcie and Eddie, Tony Caruso Jr. also finds himself in the midst of riveting mysteries. So, if you found ‘Deadloch’ interesting for its no-nonsensical investigative techniques, then you’ll find the different approaches to investigations in ‘The Good Cop’ fascinating too.</p><h2 style=text-align:center>6. Bad Sisters (2022-)</h2><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=596442 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/is-bad-sisters-based-on-a-true-story-or-a-book/bad_sisters_photo_010102-2/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Bad_Sisters_Photo_010102-1.jpg data-orig-size=1200,600 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=Bad_Sisters_Photo_010102 data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Bad_Sisters_Photo_010102-1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Bad_Sisters_Photo_010102-1.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Bad_Sisters_Photo_010102-1.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>With Sharon Horgan, Anne-Marie Duff, Claes Bang, Eva Birthistle, and Sarah Greene, ‘Bad Sisters’ follows the story of the Dublin-based Garvey sisters, who find themselves under the life insurance company’s radar after their brother-in-law’s mysterious death. Created by Sharon Horgan, similar to ‘Deadloch,’ ‘Bad Sisters’ does not shy away from delving into traumatic themes such as grief and murder. Not just this, the show also coalesces these heavy elements with comedy effortlessly. Much like ‘Deadloch’ where Eddie and Duclie find themselves unraveling the murder mystery with prospective moral undertones, ‘Bad Sisters’ also ponders on the theory of retributivism.</p><h2 style=text-align:center>5. Murderville (2022-)</h2><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=506618 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/murderville-episode-3-clues-killer-and-ending-explained/https___hiddenremote-com_files_2022_01_murderville_103_unit_02195r/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/https___hiddenremote.com_files_2022_01_MURDERVILLE_103_Unit_02195R-e1643842469371.jpg data-orig-size=2000,1000 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=Murderville data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/https___hiddenremote.com_files_2022_01_MURDERVILLE_103_Unit_02195R-e1643842469371.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/https___hiddenremote.com_files_2022_01_MURDERVILLE_103_Unit_02195R-e1643842469371.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/https___hiddenremote.com_files_2022_01_MURDERVILLE_103_Unit_02195R-e1643842469371.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Will Arnett leads the cast as Detective Terry Seattle, who has to team up with clueless guest celebrities in order to solve a murder. The catch of the show is that the guests aren’t handed a script and must improvise their investigation. Weaving mystery in an unscripted comedy, <a href=#>‘Murderville’</a> merges eccentricities with profane crimes flawlessly. Inspired by the BBC3 series ‘Murder in Successville,’ creator Krister Johnson works in the kinks of amateur investigative skills into a thrilling mystery. While ‘Deadloch’ may not follow as a thematic parallel to ‘Murderville,’ it still features all the elements of a classic mystery and includes additional improvisation in the event of an undefined script, which makes this series an equally entertaining mystery comedy to watch next.</p><h2 style=text-align:center>4.

Despite their contrasting personalities and demeanour, the one thing that binds them together is their response to said betrayal. The anthology features how in spite of their varied timelines, their reaction to infidelities has remained the same.</p><p>Starring Ginnifer Goodwin, Kirby Howell-Baptiste and Lucy Liu as the titular leads, ‘Why Women Kill,’ is yet another series that chronicles the radical steps that end in bloodshed. Created by Marc Cherry, ‘Why Women Kill’ follows a similar devastating series of events that stem from corrupted morals. So, if you were intrigued by the exploration of death and grief in ‘Deadloch,’ then you’ll find this comedy-drama equally appealing.</p><h2 style=text-align:center>3.

The cast features Tiffany Haddish, Sam Richardson, Zoë Chao, Ben Schwartz, and <a href=#>Dave Franco</a>.

Despite the axiomatic differences that place ‘Broadchurch’ on a different level than ‘Deadloch,’ creators Kate McCartney and Kate McLennan have spoken on how the show piqued their interests and have even <a href=#>referred</a> to ‘Deadloch’ as “Funny Broadchurch.” So, naturally, despite its drastic differences, ‘Broadchurch’ is still a riveting mystery that explores a number of disturbing themes and creates suspense through and through.</p><h2 style=text-align:center>1.
