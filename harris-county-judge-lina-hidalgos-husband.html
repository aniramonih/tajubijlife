Critics have criticized these actions as being overreaching. Hidalgo took office in 2019.</p><p>Mealer has positioned herself as a down-to-earth contender who will prioritize conventional county duties like roads and public safety. Hidalgo has criticized that strategy as being naive.</p><p>Either way, the new election seems to be neck and neck between these two very accomplished and deserving candidates.&nbsp;</p><h2>Some FAQs</h2><h3 class=m-0>What Political Party is Lina Hidalgo a Part of?</h3>She is a part of the Democratic party<h3 class=m-0>What County Does Lina Hidalgo Represent?</h3>She represents the Harris County in Texas<h3 class=m-0>Is Lina Hidalgo Married?</h3>No, she is not married as of yet<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirmKTEo7XZnKarppWne6S7zGifmqqinsBur86upa2xXZ%2FCpbPEZqOippFitaqwwKWeqKtdncK0rsCnmw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
