The "Big Little Lies" actor uploaded a photo of Heche to <a href=#>Instagram</a> that was color-washed, and added "love you forever" in the caption, alongside a broken heart emoji. Friends and fans alike flocked to the comment section to offer condolences to Tupper. "I'm so sorry for your loss James ... sending so much love and prayers to you and yours," one follower <a href=#>wrote</a>. "I am so deeply sorry James Anne's such a strong light loving talented powerful human being," another <a href=#>added</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>That was not Tupper's only <a href=#>Instagram</a> tribute to his ex. A day after Heche's car crash, the "Grey's Anatomy" actor uploaded a snap of Heche posing with their son, Atlas Heche Tupper. "Thoughts and prayers for this lovely woman, actress and mother tonight anneheche ... we love you," Tupper wrote in the caption.</p><p dir=ltr>Although the former couple had a contentious breakup that saw them embroiled in a legal battle, the pair had a lovely start to their relationship. The actors famously met working on the series "Men In Trees," where finding on-set romance came as a surprise to both of them. "It was unexpected," Tupper told <a href=#>Access</a> in 2007. "I'd heard a lot of things about Anne like everybody else and I came up here keeping my mind open and found this wonderful, hardworking, beautiful woman," he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm5jZn51e8mapJ6rXanCsbzEq2SpnZ6oeqa5zq2gqKaRoXqusdKsmKCdXam8brHXZpinppVitaavx55kqKZdnru0wMCgqZqlXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
