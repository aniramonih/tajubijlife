Holding an assistive walking device, Lee revealed that he had suffered an injury and would require surgery, rendering him out of action indefinitely.</p><p>Lee conveyed this news to the audience, assuring them that it wasn’t a final farewell but rather a temporary setback. He expressed his determination to return, saying he was “far from done” and concluded with a heartfelt “see you later.”</p><p>However, his emotional moment was interrupted by Dirty Dominik Mysterio, who used the opportunity to mock Lee. Dirty Dom taunted Lee about his absence from the upcoming Deadline event and suggested that Lee could spend the night with Mami Rhea Ripley.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Lee responded by hinting that while he might not be facing Dirty Dom at Deadline, he was still committed to defending the North American title at the event. The segment took an unexpected turn when Rey Mysterio appeared via video and vowed to be in the corner of Dom’s new opponent, Dragon Lee.</p><p>Dragon Lee then made a surprise entrance, setting the stage for a potentially intense showdown.</p><p>Fans of Wes Lee and NXT will undoubtedly be wishing him a swift and successful recovery as he deals with his injury and prepares to make his return to the ring.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX90e5BrZmltX6zEpnnNsatmq6SWv27DxKxkpZ2VYr%2BmwsSao6xlmaO3tr7YZqquqpeav7p5wKebZqGembKntc2iq55lkZfAprrCnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
