In most of his sermons, he delved into the concept of “chain of command” which he believed to be the divine order established by God.</p><p>According to the concept, there exists a certain relationship of dominance and submission between superiors and their subordinates and to defy this relationship is to defy the will of God. Despite the many scandals that occurred during his career, he was given the title of Bishop in the Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship in 1994 and was chosen as the officiator of the funeral of the great civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.’s wife Mrs Coretta Scott King in 2006.</p><p>He also wrote various well-received books, like ‘Your Vision Is Too Small,’ ‘The Power of a Wise Woman,’ ‘The Church: Living Without Love’ and ‘Deliver Me From Adam’ to name a few.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Eddie Long has no awards to his credit.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Eddie Long in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Eddie-Long-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, The total estimated net worth of Eddie Long at the time of his death was about $5 million, thanks to his various real estate business ventures, proceeds from his New Birth organisations and the royalties he received for his books.</p><p>The fact that he donated about $1 million to the North Carolina Central University in 2008 proves that despite the many scandals he had managed to secure a considerable fortune for himself with his sound business investments and successful books.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZLKlsMieZKWnnpx6r7HTZq6oqqSdenN8kWlka2hiZnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
