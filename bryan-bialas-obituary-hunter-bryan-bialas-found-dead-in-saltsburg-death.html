Coworkers reported him missing after he didn’t show up for work the next day.&nbsp;After receiving information from a local resident, state police located a Jeep Wrangler that belonged to Bialas in a secluded and wooded region of Young Township, Indiana County, earlier on Friday. The area was located in Indiana County.</p><p>Shortly after this, the body of Bialas was discovered during a search and rescue operation.&nbsp;According to Trooper Cliff Greenfield, on Friday morning, law enforcement officials conducted interviews with local farms and searches in the Iselin and Saltsburg districts. During the course of the previous few days, personnel from the Indiana station have received assistance from members of the aerial patrol unit of the Pennsylvania State Police, the Indiana County Emergency Management Agency, the Pennsylvania Game Commission, and firefighters from the Iselin fire department.</p><p>According to Greenfield, Bialas was a dedicated outdoorsman who enjoyed hunting and routinely visited a large number of spots in and around the Saltsburg area. Two bluetick coonhounds belonged to him.&nbsp;“We believe that when he left his residence on September 11, he may have gone somewhere to train his dogs,” he added. “This is our working hypothesis. The police have no reason to suspect foul play, and it will be up to Indiana County Coroner Jerry Overman, Jr. to decide what caused the death and how it occurred.&nbsp;Greenfield stated that the local police in the region of the Allegheny National Forest were contacted about the search and assisted with it once they learned that Bialas enjoyed hunting there. Investigators from Troops C and D, the Pennsylvania Game Commission, and the United States Forest Service were a part of this group.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwrtGymKdlkp6ura3SZqaboaSqrrPFjKGsp6yVp3qjvtiapWaamZa5or%2BMn6auppRisaatw2agp2Wjlrm1v8GuqaBllJqutbSO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
