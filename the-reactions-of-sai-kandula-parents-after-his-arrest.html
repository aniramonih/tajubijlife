Park Police and Secret Service officers rapidly approached him, ensuring that no injuries were sustained during the incident.</p><p>After the arrest, the investigator asked questions about Sai Kandula parents and about the motive behind the crash, in which he allegedly expressed his intention to destroy the government and harm President Joe Biden.</p><p>Two anonymous sources familiar with the matter revealed these details to the Associated Press. To verify Kandula’s background, a FOX 2 reporter, Mitch McCoy, went to Kandula’s former high school.</p><p>The Rockwood School District confirmed that Kandula had graduated early from Marquette High School in January 2022.</p><p>As per the school <a href=#>management</a> staff and teaching faculty members, he had been actively involved in the student council during his second year. He was also a boys’ tennis team member during his second and junior years.</p><p>Kandula’s <a href=# rel=nofollow>LinkedIn</a> profile indicates his interest in data analytics. However, he does not own any previous work experience in the field.</p><p>He claimed he had received Python and Java coding training during the investigation. He also stated that he holds certifications in Google and IBM data analysis.</p><p>Chris Zaboji, a 25-year-old pilot and an eyewitness residing in Washington, recounted his experience of the incident.</p><p>Zaboji was there, finishing a run near Lafayette Square, when he heard a loud crash. Reacting swiftly, he took out his phone and captured the moment when the truck struck the barrier again.</p><p>In an interview with a news reporter, Zaboji said, <strong>“When the van backed up and rammed it again, I decided I wanted to get out of there.”</strong></p><p>Law enforcement agencies acted promptly to neutralize the immediate danger and ensure the area’s safety.</p><p>The Secret Service, responsible for protecting the President and other high-ranking officials, quickly arrested the suspect without harming innocent civilians.</p><p>The motives behind Kandula’s alleged actions are still under investigation. The moment when he came out from the truck with a Nazi flag and made alarming statements about wanting to take over the government and harm President Biden raises serious concerns about his ideological beliefs and potential extremist movements.</p><p>These details, combined with the purposeful sort of the crash, suggest a plotted act that justified direct interference.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What will be the next steps by the Secret Service?</h2><p>Investigators will likely dig into Kandula’s background to gain further motive behind the incident, seeking any potential signs or warnings that could provide insight into his state of mind and motivations.</p><p>Attention will be given to his high school activities, such as his participation in the student council and his involvement in the boys’ tennis team, as well as his academic performance and personal interactions.</p><p>The purpose is to distinguish any potential factors that may have contributed to his alleged actions on that fateful night.</p><p>Officers from the Secret Service and the Metropolitan Police Department searched the truck after the crash.</p><p>A video posted by <a href=# rel=nofollow>WUSA-TV</a> shows a police officer at the scene picking up and taking several pieces of evidence from the truck, including a Nazi flag.</p><p>Kandula has now been taken into custody by the Park Police, facing multiple charges that include threatening the lives of the President, vice president, or their family members, as well as assault with a dangerous weapon, reckless driving, destruction of federal property, and trespassing.</p><p>The United States Secret Service maintains surveillance on countless individuals who have made threats against the President.</p><p>However, it is doubtful whether Kandula was previously known to the Secret Service or if he had made any prior threats that would have triggered their involvement.</p><p>Currently, there is no attorney listed for Kandula in court records. Multiple telephone numbers associated with his surname in public records are no longer in service, and attempts by the Associated Press to contact his relatives for their perspective have been unsuccessful.</p><p>Additionally, individuals at a Missouri residence linked to Sai Kandula parents declined to comment to the TAP reporter.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDAx55kq52RmMGqu82sZKieXaiuqnnKmqWdrZyWerGt0Z6lratdlrO1sdFmn6KrXZa%2Fs7HSrWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
