So I took it so easy. I had to," she explains in <a href=#>Glamour</a> magazine's July issue, on newsstands today. "I was still bleeding, and I was nauseated and uncomfortable—'way worse than last time,' I said to Jason. I felt seven months pregnant even though I was six weeks along. And because we hadn’t planned this, I felt unprepared, like we had so much to do to get ready for this baby. Still, I was excited, if cautiously so, with the words high risk ringing in my ears."</p><p>Unfortunately, Frankel suffered a miscarriage. Her doctor told her, " 'You're 41. You had bleeding. There's nothing you could have done.' And I hadn't done anything," she says. "Since I'd found out, I'd been lying down for an hour or two every day and lettings others take up the slack. But I blamed myself—of course I did."</p><p>And 10 days later, the Bravo star got a call from her doctor revealing she would have had a baby girl. "He told me that the tests came back as 'female fetus, normal.' He was reading off a chart, reassuring me that there wasn't some chromosomal abnormality. But all I heard was 'female,' and I fell to pieces."</p><p>The Bravo star and new host of her own talk show is already the proud mother of daughter Bryn, 2, with her husband. "I was picturing Bryn with a little sister," she recalls. "Two little girls in rain boots."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Afterward, I went through a range of emotions. There was something so sad about it—that there had been a life there, and then suddenly it was not there," Frankel explains. "There was also, I have to admit, a bit of relief that I wouldn't be starting my new TV job seven months pregnant. And then there was immense guilt at the relief."</p><p>As for whether or not she'll try to have a second child again, Frankel says it's not really up to her to decide.</p><p>"I'm healthy and could try again. But I don't want to be a 'trying' person. If it's meant to be, it will happen."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaJmerJiau6%2FFjJ%2Bpmqabmrluu8%2BepaxlpaV6oq7OrqtmqpWYsq%2FAjKagrJuRp7%2BqrcaeZKJlkqGurrHDZqSyq5Whs25%2Bj2ppampm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
