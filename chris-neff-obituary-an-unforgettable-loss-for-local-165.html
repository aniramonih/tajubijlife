When friends and fellow union workers at Local 165 learned of his untimely death in an automobile accident, they were startled and devastated. Being a part of the same union for 17 years gave me the opportunity to get to know Chris as well, if not more so than some others. Chris was a part of a close-knit family in addition to being a union worker. In the union community, he was also well-known alongside his sister Michelle and father Mike.</p><p>Although there was never a chance to develop a close relationship with Chris, I had many enjoyable conversations with his father, Mike. The Neff family exuded love, devotion, and a steadfast adherence to the union’s principles. When someone so young and full of promise is stolen from us in such an abrupt and unplanned way, it is always tragic. The grief in the community is immense,</p><p>and Chris Neff didn’t deserve to pass away in that manner. As we honor Chris, let’s not forget how important it is to treasure every second we spend with our friends, family, and coworkers since we never know when we could be taken from this life. We are sending the Neff family our deepest sympathies during this trying time. Local 165 and the people of Chillicothe will miss Chris Neff terribly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaJuYp7a0ec2enZ9ln5e2tcHAq7BmmZ5iwq%2Byzquenqyklq%2BtsYylpqyrXZu8s3nLqJqapF1mg3Z7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
