As a Bristol native, Maya attended Cotham School as a youngster but once admitted that she doesn’t have the fondest memories as a student.</p><p>Due to her mixed ethnic background, the former <a href=#>The Circle</a> host once admitted that she was bullied in school because of her East African roots.</p><p>Speaking in her Soundcloud Receipts Podcast, Maya said:</p><p>“When they asked me where I’m from I used to be like ‘yeah I’m Spanish and Jamaican’ or something like that. And just made a whole completely new background because I didn’t want people to judge me from where I was from.”</p><p>Maya is of Somali descent from her father’s side, and Swedish descent from her mother.</p><p>The celeb also explained that her surname “Jama” is a very common name in Somali, calling it “the equivalent to Jones in the UK”.</p><ul><li><strong>MORE: </strong><a style=font-size:revert;font-weight:revert href=#>Maya Jama ‘looks so good’ in tight mesh dress as fans beg her to date YouTuber</a></li></ul><h2>Maya Jama’s Upbringing</h2><p>As <a href=# rel=nofollow>reported</a> by The Guardian, Maya Jama had a traumatic upbringing.</p><p>Her dad was consistently in prison following strings of small sentences that involved violence.

At the time, Maya and Stormzy hadn’t reached major success in their respective fields yet, but they were deemed as “couple goals” by fans.</p><p>They reportedly crossed paths at a Red Bull Culture Clash event when Stormzy achieved underground success and Jama was working with <a href=#>MTV</a>.</p><p>Maya and Stormyz split in 2019 and sparked romance rumors in 2022 after being spotted together at the same event. Jama’s representatives confirmed they hadn’t reunited and remain “great friends”.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=ben-simmons>Ben Simmons</h3><p>Maya and NBA player Ben Simmons dated for one year and a half before calling it quits in August 2022. Things became serious after the TV presenter was photographed flashing a dazzling diamond ring in January 2022.</p><p>The presenter seemingly confirmed their engagement with a photo of a necklace captioned with the date “12/18/21” on her Instagram Story, adding a ring emoji to signify the date of the big day.</p><p>They broke up in summer 2022 and she has not been publically linked with any celebrity since. We think Maya can definitely stir things up as a Love Island bombshell.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfrLWiwNJmpqdnpJ2ybq%2FIq5qlnV2irrqtjKOYppldrLWiwIyiqmaglad6psDHp6CcoaSu</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
