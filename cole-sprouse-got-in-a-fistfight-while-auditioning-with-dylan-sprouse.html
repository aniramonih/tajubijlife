The twosome’s big screen debut came the following year with Big Daddy. The brothers split the role of Julian in the 1999 comedy alongside <strong>Adam Sandler</strong>.</p><p>Cole’s first big solo gig was playing Ben Geller on Friends in 2000. He had a recurring role as Ross Geller’s (<strong>David Schwimmer</strong>) son until 2002.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Cole-Sprouse-Recalls-Which-Audition-With-Dylan-Sprouse-Ended-With-a-Fistfight-and-Broken-Mirror-919.jpg><p>Three years later, Cole and Dylan rocketed to superstardom after portraying twins Cody and Zack, respectively, on Disney Channel’s <a href=#>The Suite Life of Zack & Cody</a>. They continued their roles on the subsequent spinoff, The Suite Life on Deck, which ran from 2008 to 2011.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Cole continued to find success on television playing Jughead Jones on <a href=#>Riverdale</a> from 2017 to 2023. He jumped back into film after the show’s conclusion, starring in <a href=#>2024’s Lisa Frankenstein</a>.</p><p>“I’m not a big believer in the 180 — when an actor goes from television to film and thinks, ‘I’m going to do something completely different,’” Cole told the outlet on Monday of his career trajectory. “I didn’t really want it to feel like that. I wanted it to be something that felt palatable, something that didn’t feel like a complete departure, but perhaps also something that felt just a little bit different.”</p><p>He continued: “But ultimately, at the end of the day, the way the audience perceives your career is out of your control. I just wanted to do something my kid self would love, and [Lisa Frankenstein] was it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqopJViwLG%2Bzq6qnmWXpMFutc1mmGaemajBp7XGoatmr5ieuaZ5wK6boqyZpLuqusZmrqKsmGKxurjAp2SsqKKkwrSxjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
