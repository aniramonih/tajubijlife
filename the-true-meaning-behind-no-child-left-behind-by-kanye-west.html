The law was signed by President George W. Bush in 2002 with the goal of keeping all students' academic progress in check, including special needs learners, minority groups, and children from low-income families. It faced criticism after it was passed, and the Obama administration eventually replaced it with the Every Student Succeeds Act, per <a href=#>The Washington Post</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>The theme of Kanye West's song's lyrics focuses on religious devotion and reliance on God during tough times. Rapper Vory's verse on <a href=#>"No Child Left Behind"</a>&nbsp;describes this subject, as he sings, "Back again, I used my back against the wall / Never called on y'all, never count on y'all / I'll always count on God."</p><p dir=ltr>Within the past year, Kanye and his wife Kim Kardashian separated, which has appeared to be a very emotional journey for the artist, as reported by <a href=#>TheThings</a>. In addition to the process of making it through his mother's passing, the words may reference how Kanye has had to call on God in order to endure&nbsp;this marital breakup. Furthermore, Kanye has four children with Kardashian, named North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm West, so the song's title also expresses his devotion to raising his children and never leaving them behind.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcGpgZ4J5e9OhnGasoqqybrnEmqWippdir6a0yKebZqafYrCptcudZKWdlql6o7HHoqWdZZKueqytzbKcZq%2BVqMFw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
