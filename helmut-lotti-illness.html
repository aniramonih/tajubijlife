Helmut Lotti sings in Dutch, Afrikaans, English, French, German, Russian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Italian, Latin, and Spanish. He’s sold 13 million albums and has 90 platinum and 70 gold albums.

He also visited Namibia, where he encountered young people affected with the disease. He did, however, witness the impact of HIV/AIDS on so-called “aids orphans.”</p><p>These are children who have lost their mother or both parents to AIDS. As a result, Helmut became a UNICEF Belgium Goodwill Ambassador in 1997. Following that, he paid multiple trips to UNICEF projects on the ground.</p><p>Lotti watched UNICEF emergency operations in Mozambique and Haiti, as well as nutrition programmes for malnourished babies in Burundi. He was also invited to engage in AIDS prevention and assistance programmes for HIV/AIDS-affected youngsters in Namibia and Russia.</p><p>However, no detailed information on Helmut’s ailment has been released because he has not yet declared it to the public. This information, however, is currently being reviewed and will be updated as soon as it becomes available.</p><h2>Helmut Lotti’s Upcoming Event</h2><p>01.08.2022</p><p>Overdekt Podium CERA – Franchommelaan – 8370 Blankenberge – free entrance (BE)</p><p>It’s free so go and enjoy the event.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Helmut Lotti (@helmutlottiofficial)</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX52yrbnUrWSlp6Sptm61y6WlnqujZH56gJVyZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
