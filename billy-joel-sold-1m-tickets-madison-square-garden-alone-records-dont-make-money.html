But these days, when even the current artists at the top of the charts don't necessarily make a ton of money from streaming or record sales, Joel's recent milestone of surpassing one million tickets&nbsp;for performances at <a href=#>Madison Square Garden</a> alone as reported by&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;is largely a result of his simply doing what he can to keep the cash coming in.</p><p>As a recent story from Quartz points out, the new trend away from artists making most of their living from record sales is seemingly over. 2017's overall highest paid artist&nbsp;Beyonc√© made just ten percent of her 2017 haul from record sales, the rest coming from ticket and merchandise sales connected with her world tour. But it probably has the biggest effect on older artists like Joel and&nbsp;<a href=# title="Donald Fagen Net Worth">Donald Fagen</a> of Steely Dan, who told The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;quite succinctly why he decided to go back on tour with a new backup band at 69 years old:</p><p>"When the bottom fell out of the record business a bunch of years ago, it deprived me of the luxury of earning a living from records. I don't sell enough albums to cover the cost of recording them the way I like to. For me, touring is the only way to make a living."</p><p>It might not be fair to Joel to characterize his MSG accomplishment as a simple paycheck matter, though. As his longtime agent Dennis Arfa told&nbsp;Billboard, his upcoming slate of concerts at the venue is part of an altogether busy 2018 touring schedule, which includes a run of several other world famous stadiums:&nbsp;Citizen Bank Park in Philadelphia, Boston's Fenway Park, and Wrigley Field in Chicago, all of which are seeing their fifth consecutive year of Joel concerts:</p><p>"No one's ever done that before, it's his own version of a stadium&nbsp;residency. He gives an amazing performance. People want to hear him sing his legendary songs from a catalog that contain so many iconic hits."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-250834 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-459142440.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-250834 class=wp-caption-text>Brian Ach/Getty Images</p><p>It took Joel 105 (mostly sold-out) Madison Square Garden shows to hit the million-ticket threshold, and 59 of those shows were part of his recent residency there.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnCuyKWjsmWapLKtedKoo51lYaJ6tbXCpJytq12irqW10qilZquhqq6zsYygmKuclaN6orjOp5xmqpWYvLOw0mabqKakYrqit8RmpKimla58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
