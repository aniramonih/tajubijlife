The Beast Incarnate has gone through many top stars in the business and prevailed at various major stages in his career. WWE had an idea for Lesnar to face Bray Wyatt at WrestleMania this year, but it didn’t happen. If you ask Dutch Mantell, Lesnar made the right decision.</p><p>Bray Wyatt returned to the Stamford-based promotion last October after being away for more than a year. Since then, he and LA Knight have been involved in a feud and recent sources claim that WWE wanted Wyatt to compete against Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania 39.</p><p>However, The Beast Incarnate apparently opposed the dream showdown against the former WWE Universal champion. Brock Lesnar will now face Omos at this year’s Show of Shows instead of facing Bray Wyatt.</p><p>On the recent episode of his podcast <a href=#>Story Time with Dutch Mantell</a>, the wrestling veteran gave his opinion on the subject. The former WWE manager discussed the potential reasons why Brock Lesnar would have declined to face Bray Wyatt.</p><p>“Brock don’t want to mess with it. What if he beats him? I mean what if Brock beats Bray Wyatt? Am I gonna be mad? No. Is it gonna help Brock? No. And you know Bray’ not beating him because that’s not happening period. Because they know Brock, you know, when Brock brings a problem, it’s not like, ‘ah well, he’ll come around and do it.’ No, Brock won’t come around.”</p><p>Dutch Mantell emphasized that Brock Lesnar would have walked out of the company if WWE forced him to work an angle he didn’t like. After all, Brock Lesnar has made a ton of money in his career, and he doesn’t have to work if he doesn’t want to.</p><p>“Brock’s a multi-millionaire. He’ll just get up walk out the door and keep going. So, they just can’t do anything they wanna do with Brock because, you know, they have built their own, I don’t know how to say it. They’ve built a monster in Brock because he don’t need your money anymore… But he’s damn sure not going to go into some, that he views as a lesser angle with Bray Wyatt.”</p><p>While Brock Lesnar <a href=#>is already slated to battle the Nigerian Giant, Omos </a>at WrestleMania 39, Bray Wyatt’s role in the Show of Shows is unclear at the moment. We will have to wait and see how Bray Wyatt figures into WWE’s plans for WrestleMania 39.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>What is your take on this story?
