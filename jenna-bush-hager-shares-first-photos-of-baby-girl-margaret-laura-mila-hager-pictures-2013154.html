Just two days after giving birth, a glowing <strong>Jenna Bush Hager</strong> beamed for cameras as she showed off adorable newborn daughter <strong>Margaret Laura "Mila" Hager</strong> with husband <strong>Henry Hager</strong>. In the snaps, Jenna poses with her parents, former president <strong>George W. Bush</strong> and former first lady <strong>Laura</strong>, in front of a whiteboard with the name "Mila" written inside a heart.&nbsp;</p><p>Hager and Jenna, 31, <a href=#>welcomed little Mila</a> into the world on Saturday, April 13, in New York City. The couple's bundle of joy weighed 6 lb. 15 oz. and measured 19 1/4 inches. "Both my girls are healthy and well," Hager <a href=#>told the Today show</a> in an email on Sunday, calling himself a "proud papa."</p><p>Mila is the former president's first grandchild, and he was the first to issue a statement about the family's newest addition on Sunday, April 14. "We met our beautiful granddaughter today," he said. "Jenna and Mila are healthy. And our family is elated."</p><p>Back in the Today show studios, Jenna's colleagues were celebrating as well, taking some time out of their Monday lineup to share their well-wishes for the first-time mother.</p><p>"I think she was really ready for the pregnancy to be over," co-host <strong>Matt Lauer</strong> commented after the news anchors agreed that Jenna and her tiny daughter looked like the "picture of perfection" together.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"But she wasn't ready to go because when we saw her we were like, 'Are your bags packed? Do you have the car seat? The carrier?'" <strong>Natalie Morales</strong> added. "And she was like, 'I don't have any of that stuff!'"</p><p>"Well, I predicted it would be a girl. I mean, it's 50/50," <strong>Al Roker </strong>joked, while Morales admitted that she thought the baby would be a boy.</p><p>"I predicted Yankees fan," Lauer said, to which Roker quipped, "Still could be!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajnZ6jrm6u1KyfZqCRnLKzedKhmKudo2Kzqr7SrWSpoJ%2BpvLR5zp9km5mSrnqotdGlZKaZopyus7HTZqOaraKWeq61y5pkoZmXmr9uvMicq66qlah6c3yQbGhubF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
