The popular multiplayer first-person shooter has some 200,000-400,000 players who log on every week, but there are obviously some legendary gamers who are consistently top-ranked from week to week.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is why Blizzard decided to launch the OWL â€” to showcase those players to the rest of the world.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How does the Overwatch League work?</h2><p>The OWL is made up of 20 teams, which are based in different cities from all over the globe.

The teams will play all the way up to the fall, when the playoffs begin. For a full look at the 2019 schedule, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">you can check here</a>.

There are four separate stages with 70 games played between the 20 teams per stage. After stage 4, that's when the playoffs start.
