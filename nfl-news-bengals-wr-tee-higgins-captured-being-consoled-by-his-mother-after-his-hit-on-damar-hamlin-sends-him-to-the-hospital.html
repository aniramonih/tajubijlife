With the Cincinnati Bengals taking on the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Buffalo Bills</a>, they set the stage for a grand fight between two beasts in the AFC. However, in the first quarter of the game, Bills‚Äô safety, Damar Hamlin, collapsed after a taking a hit by Bengals‚Äô wide receiver Tee Higgins. The game had to be stopped and the medical personnel monitored the safety after he received CPR on the field.</p><p>Following the hit, Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest. Fortunately, his heartbeat was restored on the field. They then rushed Hamlin to a hospital, where 24-year-old still remains under critical condition. After holding discussions with both the head coaches, Zac Taylor and Sean McDermott, the refs sent the teams back to the locker room. Further monitoring the developments of the night, the league postponed the game. Both the sides were visibly shaken up by what had happened in front of their eyes. Especially the Bills who were concerned for their teammate.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just stood with Tee Higgins‚Äô mom who is now walking out with Tee who has his arm wrapped around her.
