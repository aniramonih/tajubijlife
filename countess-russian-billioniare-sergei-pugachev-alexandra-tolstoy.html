Alexandra worked as a broker in London before beginning her own travel business, and tied the knot to her first husband Shamil Galimzyanov before meeting Sergei in 2008 and falling deeply in love. Speaking of their relationship, Alexandra told the BBC: "When I met Sergei, it was electric. I fell so in love with him. It was so romantic, I've never felt such a connection with someone." Sergei was a Russian oligarch with a huge amount of wealth, and Alexandra explained: "He'd give me his credit card and I'd go shopping, I could do what I liked," she says. "I had a private jet. I just had to pack my suitcase and go."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5fe2f2c601e3-alexandra-tolstoy-z-1-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ey77vn47nzr4 data-wc=9><strong>Alexandra is related to famed late author Leo Tolstoy</strong></p><h2>Who is Sergei Pugachev?</h2><p id=eb9gO7xvlwQo data-wc=50>Sergei is a Russian oligarch who was, at one time, a close friend to President Vladimir Putin.

Alexandra explained: "We have a PA, two drivers, two housekeepers, an English nanny, and a Russian nanny as well as a French teacher for homework. We moved here just after I'd had my first baby.

She explained: "Sergei had one of his explosions where he physically attacked me," she says.

Speaking in the documentary, she claimed that she thought her lifestyle with Sergei was "vulgar", explaining: "As an adult you can lose yourself. I really never thought I could lose myself.
