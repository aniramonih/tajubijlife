However, her photos sparked a great deal of speculation. Find out why.</p><p class=dh>Renowned TV producer and philanthropist Camille Cosby is widely admired for the unconditional love she has for her husband, actor Bill Cosby, her spouse for the last 57 years and counting.</p><p class=dh>When Bill was released from jail following a court's overturning of his sexual assault conviction, Camille felt relieved and ecstatic. She could finally continue her bond with her husband without prison bars between them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/d45ea0b5fd75d44bd2a5af4c8836bf1c.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Bill Cosby at the Montgomery County Courthouse for the fifth day of his retrial for sexual assault charges on April 13, 2018. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Amid Camille's solid marriage with the veteran comedian, she was plagued with controversies. TMZ reported she was pictured with <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.tmz.com/2021/07/18/bill-cosby-wife-camille-seen-nyc-not-wearing-wedding-ring/>no ring on her finger</a> when she stepped into a New York City building.</p><p class=dh>Camille looked casual and light as she donned a navy blue cardigan with bird prints and tie-dye pants. Aside from being ringless, she had no earrings. She did wear a red watch and a multi-colored bracelet.</p><p class=dh>The 77-year-old producer's photo led to public speculation that she might have ended her more than five-decade marriage with Bill, with whom she shares five adult children.</p><p class=dh>Camille could be remembered sporting a wedding ring during her husband's trial in 2017. Meanwhile, her representative Andrew Wyatt set the record straight. Denying the breakup speculations, he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tmz.com/2021/07/18/bill-cosby-wife-camille-seen-nyc-not-wearing-wedding-ring/>told</a> TMZ:</p><p class=dh>"It's hilarious because Mr. & Mrs. Cosby have been happily married for 57 years and counting."</p><p class=dh>Wyatt added that he knew many longtime couples who don't wear their wedding rings for more than 30 years yet are still very much together.</p><p class=dh>Wyatt dismissed those who shared the rumors as "media insurrectionists" who are desperate to find a negative story about Camille, a strong Black woman who has stood by her husband's innocence since 2018.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>The couple's reunion happened before Bill's 84th birthday on July 12.</strong></h3><p class=dh>Bill was convicted of a sexual assault case in 2018, but a Philadelphia judge <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bill-cosbys-wife-camille-reacts-ahead-of-prison-release/>recently overturned</a> his conviction and released him from Philadelphia prison on June 30, 2021.</p><p class=dh>Bill's release left many people feeling disappointed. Amid the criticisms, Camille insisted her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://abcnews.go.com/US/camille-cosby-ready-act/story?id=71267941">husband is innocent</a> and that his female accusers have no proof he committed a crime.</p><p class=dh>An outspoken wife, she lambasted the #MeToo Movement <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://pagesix.com/2020/06/24/bill-cosbys-wife-camille-breaks-silence-suggests-metoo-movement-is-racist/>as racist</a>. She stated the group ignored the fact that white women have historically been involved in falsely accusing Black men of sexual assault.</p><p class=dh>The comedy legend had served two years of his three to ten years sentence. Following his acquittal, he returned to his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://nypost.com/2021/07/01/bill-cosby-leaving-pennsylvania-to-reunite-with-wife-camille/>Pennsylvania home</a> and then to his New York City home to be reunited with Camille.</p><p class=dh>Since his release from prison, the house staff took care of Bill and did not leave their home in New York's Upper East Side of Manhattan. The couple purchased their home for $6.2 million in 1987.</p><p class=dh>Camille was excited to meet him because she had not seen him since he was sent to jail. Besides setting the record straight about the couple's relationship, Wyatt also described their heartwarming reunion on July 1.</p><p class=dh>Wyatt previously told the Daily Mail that the couple's reunion <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9800527/Camille-Cosby-seen-without-wedding-ring-leading-speculation-57-year-marriage.html>was emotional</a> and similar to watching a "teenage love." He added that Bill lovingly called his wife "My dear Camille."</p><p class=dh>The couple's reunion happened before Bill's 84th birthday on July 12. During the actual celebration of his special day, he had a fresh haircut for his birthday dinner and shared a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CRP0r_4lXUq/>sweet message</a> to his wife.</p><p class=dh>He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/bill-cosby-birthday-message-supporters-vigil-protesting-prison-release>thanked his supporters</a> for fighting for his freedom.
