The former pair separated from a decade-long marriage but raised their children with great virtue. Today, we will be talking about one of Spottiswoode’s kids, his daughter, Lily Spottiswoode.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>So, let’s start.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Roger_Spottiswoodes_Daughter_Lily_Is_In_The_Entertainment_Industry></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Roger Spottiswoode’s Daughter, Lily Is In The Entertainment Industry</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Director Roger Spottiswoode’s daughter, Lily, also chose to enter the entertainment industry and continue his legacy. She acts as the producer and director for several notable movies.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Spottiswoode’s IMDb</a> shows that she has served as an assistant producer for television series 16 and Pregnant in 2014.

Furthermore, Lily understands the seriousness of learning and hence struggled her way up. She worked as a story researcher for tv series documentary, P.O.V.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lily_Spottiswoode_Is_An_Actress_As_Well></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Lily Spottiswoode Is An Actress As Well&nbsp;</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Roger Spottiswoode’s daughter, Lily, is great behind cameras. However, she does not shy away from showing her inherited acting skills on-screen.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to Lily’s IMDb, she has appeared in a couple of movies like One Small Hitch and The Bullet. Furthermore, she also appeared in Biography in 2001. Moreover, she also <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">wrote and performed</a> a show, The Meanest Guy That Ever Lived. The show depicted her grandfather <strong>Jack Palance</strong>‘s final days at his California home.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Born on January 29, 1987, Lily is optimistically looking forward to her future entertainment industry. Let’s hope we hear more of Roger Spottiswoode’s daughter, Lily’s works in the coming days.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jack_Palances_Granddaughter_Lily_is_The_Eldest_of_Two></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jack Palance’s Granddaughter, Lily, is The Eldest of Two</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The former couple, Roger Spottiswoode and actress, <strong>Holly Palance</strong> shared vows on April 9, 1983. The couple welcomed two kids from their decade-long marriage, Lily Spottiswoode being the eldest.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The beautiful Lily grew up hearing her grandpa’s works, witnessing her father, Roger, and mom, Holly’s stage shows. Additionally, she also had a good company of her younger brother, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Spencer Spottiswoode</strong></a>, as she grew up. The siblings only have two years’ differences. Hence they could have bonded pretty well.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Unfortunately, Roger is a private person and maintains the secrecy with his children too. There is not much about their childhood, nor their present days, since Lily is not present in social media.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Regrettably, Roger and Holly Palance divorced after 14 years of marriage in 1997. Although there is no news of Roger Spottiswoode’s re-marriage, Lily’s Spootuswoode’s mother, Holy Palance, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">shared vows</a> with journalist<strong> Robert Wallace</strong> in 2010.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Holly-Palance-1.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;As mentioned earlier, Lily is living a private life. Therefore, she has no social media, well, not that we found, no controversial tabloids, and a squeaky clean career. Sadly, we might not even know who Lily Spottiswoode’s husband/boyfriend is.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, let’s hope Lily decides to join social media to share her happy news in the coming days and stay healthy and succeed.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Name_Meaning-_Lily></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Name Meaning- Lily&nbsp;</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The name Lily means my God is abundance” and “lily flower.” It has a Greek origin.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For more updates on&nbsp;</span><a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Entertainment</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span><a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Celebrity Babies</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span><a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>YouTubers</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, and&nbsp;</span><a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Movies TV Series</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;follow&nbsp;</span><a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>eCelebrityMirror</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq7JlkpavqrHSaKOipKliwLG7062grK%2BfpLGmedGonp6qXai9sMDToqqwp5%2BZsm6wwK6eoayVp3qpu8ulsGaokaGur6%2FEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
