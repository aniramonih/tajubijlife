Seibold, a 60-year-old Temecula resident, was the pilot and the owner of the single-engine Beechcraft A36, which crashed in a small vacant field approximately a mile east of Big Bear Airport. While there were no fires or structural damages, the incident is currently under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), who will be examining the crash location, air traffic communications, radar data, weather reports, and interviewing potential witnesses to determine the cause of the crash. Despite reports of a distress signal being issued by the pilot, the Big Bear Airport’s general manager, Ryan Goss, stated that they did not receive or hear any such signal before the crash. The NTSB’s preliminary inquiry confirms that Big Bear Airport was the plane’s destination.</span></p><p><span><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/galaxylands.com.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stormie-Seibold-1.jpg alt width=1024 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><h2><span>For Stormie Seibold family is everything</span></h2><p><span>Stormie Seibold, the pilot and owner of the plane that crashed near Big Bear Airport, was a beloved family man and an adventurer, according to those who knew him. His wife, Kay Seibold, spoke highly of him, saying that he had at least 25 years of flying experience and was always ready for emergencies.</span></p><p><span>Kay revealed that she and her husband had promised to die together, as they couldn’t imagine living without one another. She shared that Stormie and two friends had taken off from French Valley Airport and flew to Corona Municipal Airport to pick up another friend. From there, they were heading to Big Bear to check out a plane that was for sale. Tragically, the plane crashed about a quarter-mile from the airport, killing all three men.</span></p><p><span>Kay also mentioned that her husband was a skilled pilot who would go out and fly in windy weather by himself to practice and learn how to land when the wind was blowing in a particular direction. She said that Stormie, who had over two decades of flying experience, was always aiming to excel in whatever he did.</span></p><p><span>As friends and family mourn the loss of Stormie and the two other men who died in the crash, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is actively investigating the cause of the incident. They are examining the crash location, air traffic communications, radar data, weather reports, and interviewing potential witnesses to determine what led to the tragedy.</span></p><p><span><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/galaxylands.com.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Stormie-Seibold-3.jpg alt width=1024 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span> <span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span> <span class=post-views-count>58</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifkaGuucXLmqWdq16YvK561admsKCfYsSiv4ysq6iqnZ6ybr%2FEopmopJRig3F52J6Yq6tdpLmlec%2Bio6isXaC2rbjEnWSipl2Xtqh5wZ6Yq2WRnr%2BxuMCnnGabopbAqXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
