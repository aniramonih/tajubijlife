According to the Seals and Croft <a href=#>Spotify</a> biography, Seals was a multi-instrumentalist, mastering the guitar, saxophone, and fiddle. Seals and Dash Crofts released their first album in 1969, but what quickly set them apart was their strong Baháʼí faith, described by&nbsp;<a href=#>ABC Action News</a> as&nbsp;an "embrace [of] the world's largest religions such as Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and Christianity."&nbsp;When both Seals and Croft converted in 1972, their music became heavily influenced by their Baháʼí beliefs, per <a href=#>Variety</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>As soft rock began to fade from the music scene in the 80s, the duo created the 1980 album, "The Longest Road," and this was the last project they released before taking a hiatus from releasing music altogether. Seals spent his post-music career time moving around the world and having three children, per <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>. Seals and Crofts reunited in 2004 and released their final album, "Traces." Even after his death, Seales' impact will be felt through the future generations he touched. This includes two of his cousins — country artists Brady and Troy — and his uncle Chuck, per <a href=#>Variety</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>"[Jim] was an enigma and I always had regard for his opinion," John Ford Coley, who was in a band with Jim's late brother, Dan Seals, wrote on <a href=#>Facebook</a> after his death. "This is a hard one on so many levels as this is a musical era passing for me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcXBoZoZ4e9OhnGasopa0qq%2BMnZyarJhivKd50q6kpp2iYq%2BzscSznGarmaO0pr6Mo6CmZaOarq2%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
