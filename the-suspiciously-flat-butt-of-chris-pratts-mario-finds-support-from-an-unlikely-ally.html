Can't relate.</p>— Sonic the Hedgehog (@SonicMovie) <a href=#>October 7, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=595 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>The account for the Sonic the Hedgehog movie and its sequel was making a self-aware nod to the fact that the Blue Blur’s original design in the film was notoriously unattractive to many when the first trailer dropped back in 2019. The backlash was so bad that fan petitioning eventually led to director Jeff Fowler redesigning the character for the entire movie, though our grandkids probably won’t believe us when we tell them. This caused the film to be pushed back to a 2020 release date into theaters, a couple of months before the COVID-19 pandemic left its mark on the world.</p><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>Luckily, it all worked out in the end for Sonic as the first film became one of the last theatrical box office hits that captured the world’s attention prior to pandemic-inspired lockdowns putting a pause on the movie industry entirely for more than a year. The film and it’s sequel, this year’s Sonic the Hedgehog 2, are now considered to be two of the finest videogame adaptations ever made.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>The consensus so far is that Mario’s design—other than his rear-end—is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nowhere near as cringe-inducing as Ugly Sonic</a>, the moniker for the abandoned design of Sonic that was parodied in the Chip n’ Dale: Rescue Rangers movie earlier this year.</p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=644 data-injectable=false>No, what <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fans are truly taking issue with is Mario’s voice</a>, as portrayed by Chris Pratt in the movie. Though an over-the-top and stereotypical Italian accent may not have worked well for a full-length movie, Pratt has chosen to go way too far on the opposite end of the spectrum by simply sounding like himself in the movie’s initial teaser, which has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">infuriated many fans</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXajCtLzInKCoraOhxm6yy5qrZpqlqcFuu8VmmqGqmah6sb7ArausZZ2Wv6q7jJ%2Bgp5yjYsC2vM%2Boqa1llqe8rnnAp2SuppyeuKa42GaYpaSpZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
