The SNL alum has already committed a number of new tattoos to the relationship since the two started dating in October. Since she did pass the “baby bar” exam, one actually states, “My girl is a lawyer.” Kim’s name has also been tattooed on him in the manner of Yellowstone. It’s interesting to note that after Davidson’s most recent tattoo, Kanye West’s girlfriend also got one for Ye, Coincidence?</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pete-davidson-jasmine-aladdin-tattoo.jpg alt width=798 height=490 sizes="(max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The comedian was first seen with Kim Kardashian a few weeks ago in Los Angeles while sporting new tattoos that read “KNSCP” on his neck, according to Page Six. North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm are thought to be the first initials of Kim and all four of her children. It turns out that Kanye West, the father of those children, is also a fan of making significant, long-lasting declarations. On her Instagram posts, his girlfriend of four months, Chaney Jones, displayed what appears to be a “Ye” wrist tattoo. Examine it below:</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/C4iyQpCv8WzBB6YHTuLqzi-970-80.jpg.jpg alt width=970 height=1742 sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The rapper’s new legal name is there, albeit it’s a little hard to read. To clarify a bit, here is a screenshot that has been slightly zoomed in:</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/nPMCtGvjWRbN5cthFSfPvS-970-80.jpg.jpg alt width=970 height=584 sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Kanye West has reportedly had three girlfriends since Kim Kardashian filed for divorce from him in February 2021, with the 24-year-old being the most recent. Prior to Chaney Jones, actress Julia Fox gained notoriety for how she pronunced “Uncut Jahmz” and for essentially claiming to be the rapper’s “muse.” Which is odd as Pete Davidson currently uses Kim as the inspiration for his most recent tattoo, while Jones appears to be doing the same with Ye. Hopefully, this relationship will last longer than the others, or she may need to contact Davidson’s tattoo removal professional.</p><p>Numerous comparisons have implied that Chaney Jones is a “Kim Kardashian lookalike” ever since Ye and his girl started dating. Jones, it seems, doesn’t even notice the similarities. Kardashian herself had spoken out about the ongoing hullabaloo surrounding individuals copying her style, claiming that it was unfair to those particular ladies, even before she was aware of her ex-new husband’s relationship.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/416682_3478201_updates.jpg alt width=700 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The fact that Kim Kardashian, Pete Davidson, and Kanye West have been involved in a contentious online feud during the same time as Chaney Jones’ new romance does not necessarily suggest that the three of them are best friends. Following his 24-hour Instagram suspension and exclusion from the 2022 Grammy performances due to his online activity, Ye is claimed to have permanently terminated the aforementioned conflict. Before that, though, he had a lot of firm opinions about Davidson and his children.</p><p>Kim and Kanye West have been depicted as having reasonably decent relations in the first season of the popular reality family’s new streaming series The Kardashians. The Grammy winner even flew over to Ray J to pick up what’s left of her old sex tape. (Ray J vehemently refutes that this is how things transpired.) The tone of the reality star’s quips during his time as host of SNL, however, is said to have soured things; yet, the most recent episode gave hints that the romance with Pete Davidson was only getting started. So perhaps Ye simply didn’t enjoy the Aladdin/Jasmine kissing act on the show?</p><p>The Kardashians releases new episodes every Thursday; these new episodes will provide us greater insight into the intricate relationship (with a Hulu subscription). But for now, what do you think of a very new lover having child names or initials tattooed on him? names of the partners after a short period of dating? It’s a risky move, for better or worse, there’s no disputing it.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
