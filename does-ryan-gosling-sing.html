Let‚Äôs start with the bad: We regret to inform you that the iconic song ‚ÄúBarbie Girl‚Äù song by Danish pop group Aqua, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">won't be featured</a> in the Barbie live action-movie.</p><p>The exact reason is unclear, but let it be known that Mattel and Aqua's label got into a legal scuffle after the song's release, so clearly the brand isn't a fan.</p><p>But the good news is that the Barbie live-action film will have a fantastic musical component that definitely makes up for it.</p><p>Some top artists have tracks on "Barbie The Album," as well as one surprise guest. Who is it exactly? We unveil him below.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">These artists ‚Äî plus Ryan Gosling ‚Äî will be featured on the album for the ‚ÄúBarbie‚Äù live-action movie.</h2><p>In May 2023, the Twitter account <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@concertleaks</a> dropped a partial list of artists who will be featured on ‚ÄúBarbie The Movie‚Äù soundtrack.</p><p>The list included <a href=#>Dua Lipa</a>, <a href=#>Ice Spice</a>, Ava Max, <a href=#>Lizzo</a>, <a href=#>Haim</a>, Tame Impala, <a href=#>Charli XCX</a>, and other famed musicians.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Artists featured on Barbie The Album <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kiTZqvrCO2</a></p>‚Äî üèÅ (@concertleaks) <a href=#>May 25, 2023</a></figure><p>But surprisingly, <a href=#>Ryan Gosling,</a> who plays <a href=#>Ken</a> in the film, was also listed as an artist.</p><p>As one user on Twitter wrote in response to the tweet: ‚ÄúAre we just gonna gloss over the fact that Ryan Gosling is listed here?‚Äù</p><p>Our thoughts exactly.

Yes, he released an album with his band Dead Man's Bones in 2009.</h2><p>Yes, Ryan can sing. While he previously showed off his pipes in La La Land and as a child in the Micky Mouse Club, there's more to his music career than that. He is actually one-half of the music duo Dead Man‚Äôs Bones. Film producer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zach Shields</a> is his counterpart.</p><p>The duo released their self-titled debut album in 2009 in collaboration with the Silverlake Conservatory Children‚Äôs Choir. The reason behind that collaboration is unclear, but below, you can see Ryan and Zach performing with them.</p><p>Peep Ryan on the piano!</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>To make things even more interesting, Ryan apparently didn't play as himself in Dead Man's Bones. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clevver News</a>, he was starting to get big in the movie world at the time of the band's inception. To conceal his A-list identity, he came up with the stage name "Baby Goose," which is a play on words of his last name.</p><p>So that's the scoop on Ryan's music career!</p><p>Fingers crossed that he'll do a song with his Barbie co-star <a href=#>Margot Robbie</a>. After all, if you read the final print of the "Barbie The Album" artist list, there are still more artists to be named.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4yrsJqmXZy8tLjIp55mq5mjtA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
