Despite his passing, his memory lives on through the Matt Adams Scholarship Endowment for Men’s Basketball at Texas Tech.</p><p>Matt Adams was a man of many talents and passions. He was a gifted athlete who attended Texas Tech on a football scholarship as a walk-on before returning home to take over the family farm. He was also an avid boxer, sponsoring young boxers and winning a Golden Gloves title at the provincial level.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>But perhaps most importantly, Matt Adams was a devoted family man who loved God and his community. He served on the school board and was a founding member of the Fibertex Gin, a local business that has been a cornerstone of the Brownfield economy for decades.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Mark Adams has spoken candidly about the profound impact that his brother’s absence has had on his life. But thanks to the efforts of the Texas Tech community, Matt Adams’s legacy will live on through the scholarship endowment that bears his name.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mark-adam-s-brother-matt-adam-scholarship-fund><strong>Mark Adam’s brother, Matt Adam scholarship fund</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The goal of the endowment is to raise $100,000 to fund an endowed scholarship for one of the members of the Texas Tech Men’s Basketball team. The scholarship will be awarded to a player who embodies the values that Matt Adams held dear: hard work, dedication, and a commitment to excellence both on and off the court.</p><p>The outpouring of support from the Red Raider faithful has been overwhelming, with over $15,000 raised in just a few days. The event’s organizers hope to make it possible for anyone, regardless of financial status, to contribute to the scholarship fund and show their school spirit.</p><p>In the past, the Texas Tech community has rallied around its own to establish scholarship funds in honour of other beloved figures like Gabe Rivera and Michael Crabtree. The Matt Adams Scholarship Endowment for Men’s Basketball is a fitting tribute to a man who represented the best of West Texas and will inspire generations of Red Raiders to come.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdoq6zt4yam5qlo2Kvs7vToZyrZZ2WwbV5wJ2Ypmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
