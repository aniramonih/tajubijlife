This would make Judas the only Apostle who was not from Galilee, if that was the case.</p><p dir=ltr>Rather than his last name, not much is given on the origins of Judas. He is referred to as Judas the son of Simon, but who Simon Iscariot was is unknown. What is known, however, is that Judas was the treasurer for Jesus and the other Apostles, but he was known to steal from the common purse from time to time, according to <a href=#>Britannica</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>Eventually, Judas was given 30 silver pieces in exchange for the location of Jesus, and at the Garden of Gethsemane, Judas kissed Jesus on the cheek to identify him to the authorities, which led to Jesus' subsequent arrest and crucifixion on the cross, according to Learn Religions. After Jesus' death, according to the Gospel account, it is said that Judas felt guilty for his actions, returned the silver pieces, and killed himself. However, there are different variations of this story. In one version he returned the silver and hanged himself, whereas in another story he bought a field and threw himself down, and his bowels burst out from under him, according to Britannica.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know is having suicidal thoughts, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by dialing 988 or by calling 1-800-273-TALK (8255)​.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j2pna3FpZMSpu4ywmKxlmqqxor%2BMoqqcmaKevLV506GcZpyZqLCqvMueZLCgn2KvpsDRmrCenF2fsrTB0maaoaqZqMFw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
