The 75-year-old said she was “treated like s**t,” and it even made her “want to cry.”</p><p>Ironically, she was treated like “royalty” while at the Jazz and Heritage Festival in New Orleans. “Let me be clear, not the people or Delta, but TSA, were over the top,” the performer explained. In another message, Diana said it wasn’t what happened to her but “how.”</p><p>Referring to the way in which the TSA agents patted her body down, the iconic entertainer insinuated it was far beyond how she’s typically treated at the airport. Moreover, the TSA agent supposedly told her that it was her job, as she patted down her legs and back, making her feel like she was a criminal.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw3IIDjJ1vi/</p><p>A spokesperson who spoke with People Magazine claimed that, from CCTV footage, the usual protocol was taken. In their statement,&nbsp; TSA officials admitted their awareness to Diana’s complaints about her airport experience.</p><p>Experiences at the airport have become a common talking point in American culture since the TSA and other institutions vamped up security following the September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Twin Towers in New York City.</p><p>In 2017, airport security pulled an Asian-American man off a United Airlines flight due to it being overbooked. Mr. David Dao, a doctor from Kentucky, was dragged off of the airplane, and many believed it had something to do with the fact he was Asian-American.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>However, it’s important to note the altercation involving Dr. David Dao had nothing to do with TSA agents and had more to do with the actual airline. Either way, Americans all over the nation know that flying can sometimes be a challenging experience, and it appears that even legends such as Diana Ross can’t avoid them.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUnq6vrYyrpqyrXaeyt7HApapmmqKqwaK4jK2pnpmkorKvwIybsGaso5Z6orPEp6usZZGperW0xGaYoqqgpL%2B1eZFwcG1vZmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
