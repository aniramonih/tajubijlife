They signed <a href=# rel=noopener>Shohei Ohtani</a> to a historic deal worth $700 million, and their 12-year, $325 million contract for <a href=# rel=noopener>Yoshinobu Yamamoto</a> — a record for a pitcher — put the team over $1 billion in free agent contracts.</p><p>This MLB season is officially underway, but the Dodgers aren't done spending.</p><p>The Dodgers and catcher <a href=# title="Will Smith Net Worth">Will Smith</a> agreed to a ten-year, $140 million contract. Smith, who just turned 29 years old, should remain in Los Angeles for the rest of his career — and he'll be paid until well after he retires.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-361747 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1677321961.jpg alt width=900 height=666 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-361747 class=wp-caption-text>Harry How/Getty Images</p><p>Smith's new deal includes a $30 million signing bonus. He'll receive $15 million of that bonus in November 2024 and the other $15 million in January 2025. The majority of his contract ($90 million) will be paid out over the next ten seasons, though a portion of it will be deferred.</p><p>From 2034 to 2043, Smith will get $5 million per season. That money won't accrue any interest, but it's yet another big-money, long-term deal on the books for the Dodgers. Beyond Ohtani and Yamamoto, the Dodgers also have <a href=# rel=noopener>Mookie Betts</a> on a $365 million contract that expires after the 2032 season.</p><p>Like Smith, Ohtani will continue earning money long after his deal technically ends. Most of his money is deferred; he'll get $2 million per season for the next ten years, with the remaining $680 million of his contract coming from 2034 to 2043.</p><p>Smith, who was drafted in 2016, reached his first All-Star team last season, and the Dodgers expect him to take another big leap this year. He'll continue to be a threat in the lineup alongside Betts and <a href=# rel=noopener>Freddie Freeman</a>, with Ohtani adding another impressive bat to the roster.</p><p>Both of these contracts are designed to give the Dodgers more financial flexibility for the short-term. By owing less money to some players over the next few seasons, the team has room to offer big deals to other players. And they clearly aren't shy about spending.</p><p>Will it turn into another title? The Dodgers have been perennial contenders but have only won one championship since 1988, which happened during the COVID-19-shortened 2020 season.</p><p>Yet the Dodgers are once again going all in. If they win the World Series — or multiple championships — the investment will be well worth it. Otherwise, it'll be another expensive disappointment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2fnmWUpLGosdGsZKOto6l6qK3VnmSwoZyherS5yK2fZqafqXq1tMRmmJysn6d6orqMamtpZZ2eua21zqdknrCkmru0tc6nZK2gkal6uLXLpWSpmalitaq5jK2fq6elnLVufo9tamg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
