That sprawling property is where the devastated actor ran to when word of Kristen’s home wrecking exploits were first revealed back in July.&nbsp; A friend close to the couple revealed to <strong><a rel=nofollow href=#>Look</a>:</strong></p><p>“Kristen was getting through to Rob, when she begged him to meet her face to face so they could talk and he has agreed to see her.&nbsp; The friend said that Rob understands that it must be worse for her because she’s not just dealing with heartbreak, but being portrayed as a villain, while he gets all the sympathy.”</p><p>I have to wonder if it’s really sympathy that is drawing Rob towards Kristen.&nbsp; Isn’t it more likely to be anger?&nbsp; Don’t you think that now that the dust has settled he has a thing or two to say to her? Why on earth would he feel bad for the woman that fell asleep beside him after screwing their married former boss?&nbsp; I would imagine he is still disgusted by her and maybe meeting will give him closure.</p><p>Do you think these two will meet to reconcile? Would Rob take Kristen back after so publicly rallying against cheaters in the past?&nbsp; Tell us your thoughts in the comments below!</p><p>Ain’t She Sweet</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#><img decoding=async title=kstew src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebdirtylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/kristen_stewart_dropped1.jpg alt=kstew width=450 height=639 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Photo Credit: FAMEFLYNET</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaGtnoqSvpr7TZqearKSeu7S7zWaYp5xdoL%2Bqv9OepWarpJrEor7TZqmem5%2BjsKq4yJqroqeeYr%2BmsdKeZLChpJ2ys7%2FPqKanq12nrq%2Bvx2ZncWtgZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
