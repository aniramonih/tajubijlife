<span class=val><a href=./categories/post>post</a></span></div><h1 class=headline itemprop=headline>The Phoenix Suns Just Sold For A Record Amount To A Former NCAA Walk-On</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>In December, Mat Ishbia <a href=#>agreed to purchase</a> the Phoenix Suns and Mercury from embattled owner <a href=# rel=noopener>Robert Sarver</a>. That move became official on February 6, as the NBA announced the league approved the sale to Ishbia with a unanimous 29-0 vote. Only the Cleveland Cavaliers abstained from voting.</p><p>The deal values the Suns and Mercury at a record $4 billion â€” no NBA franchise has ever had that high of a valuation. Ishbia, a billionaire real estate mogul, and his brother Justin agreed to purchase all of Sarver's shares, plus some stakes from minority partners. While the exact valuation hasn't been confirmed, it's a safe bet to assume the Ishbias are spending between $2 and $2.5 billion in the deal.</p><p>Mat Ishbia will serve as the team's governor, while Justin will act as alternate governor. The move comes mere days before the NBA trade deadline.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-343707 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463223969.jpg alt="Phoenix Suns owner Mat Ishbia laughing during a game." width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-343707 class=wp-caption-text>Nic Antaya/Getty Images</p><p>Though this is the highest valuation in NBA history, it's not the most an individual owner has spent on a basketball team. <a href=# rel=noopener>Joseph Tsai</a> paid $3.3 billion in 2919 for the Brooklyn Nets and Barclays Center. In 2017, <a href=# rel=noopener>Tilman Fertitta</a> dropped $2.2 billion on the Houston Rockets.</p><p>Ishbia played basketball in college, walking on at Michigan State. Though he was never the biggest star on the team, he played in 48 games and won a national championship in 2000 under coach <a href=# rel=noopener>Tom Izzo</a>.</p><p>Today, Ishbia is the chairman, president, and CEO of United Wholesale Mortgage. He's got a higher net worth than <a href=# rel=noopener>Michael Jordan</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>LeBron James</a> combined.</p><p>Sarver bought the Suns in 2004. He spent $401 million to purchase the team then, which was a record at the time. After this sale, he'll make about five times what he spent nearly two decades ago. Not a bad exit strategy.</p><p>Oh, and remember how the Cavaliers abstained from voting? United Wholesale Mortgage is a major rival to Quicken Loans, the company founded by Cavs owner <a href=# rel=noopener>Dan Gilbert</a>.</p><p>If the Suns and Cavs end up in the NBA Finals, the trash-talking between the owner's boxes might be even worse than on the court.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2fnmWgnbymusixZKytnqh6q8HSrWSsp5yZeqe70WaYZqqVmLyzsIyapKitnql6tbuMmmSfp6KisrN5zZyYmmWnlrmsec6nZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
