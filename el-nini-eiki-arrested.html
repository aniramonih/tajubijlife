Biography & Parents Details</strong></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>El Nini is accused of leading a ruthless group of bodyguards providing protection for the sons of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán. Moreover, he is one of the most feared hitmen for the Chapitos, tasked with kidnapping, torturing, and killing rival drug traffickers. As per records, he was detained in Culiacán, the capital of the state of Sinaloa, which is the stronghold of the cartel of the same name. However, El Nini has yet to have a Wikipedia page.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>El Nini was born Nestor Isidro Perez Salas to his parents in Mexico. However, there is no information regarding his parents in the public media. Moreover, he has always remained private about his parents and hasn't talked much about them. His parents haven't been brought up in the public media due to security reasons. The names of his father and his mother are yet to be available to the public. Other than that, there is no information regarding his siblings, so it's hard to tell the number of brothers and sisters he has.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>El Nini enjoys celebrating his birthday on 9 March every year with his family and friends. Moreover, he was born on 9 March 1992, which makes him 31 years old at the time of writing. Looking at his date of birth, El Nini has Pisces as his zodiac or birth sign. Meanwhile, as he was born in Mexico, he holds Mexican nationality. Besides that, El Nini comes from a family of Latin ethnic background and follows Christianity as his religion.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Regarding his educational background, there is no proper information regarding El Nini's educational journey. As he has been involved in crime all his life, he at most might be a high school graduate. At the age of 31, El Nini looks fabulous in his height of 5 feet and 8 inches with a decent weight.</span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:18pt><strong>El Nini Dating Life</strong></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>El Nini seemed to be single at the time of his arrest and didn't have any girlfriends at that moment. Moreover, he has always remained private about his personal life and hasn't brought much about his dating life on any form of social media handles. Meanwhile, as he has been in crime for all his life, he never got any chances to build any form of solid relationship.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>At the same time, as El Nini has always remained private about his personal life, there is an equal chance that he had a girlfriend and had been able to keep her away from the public eye.</span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:18pt><strong>El Nini Career & Net Worth</strong></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>El Nini was a high-ranking lieutenant in the&nbsp;Sinaloa Cartel, who was the head of security for the sons of&nbsp;El Chapo, the former boss of the Cartel. He is accused by the U.S. State Department of working under Ivan Archivaldo Guzman to lead the "Ninis," a violent group of security personnel for the Guzman brothers, also known as Los Chapitos. Moreover, he is thought to have been behind the group's retaliation for Ovidio Guzmán López's 2019 arrest. As per records, he and his security forces murdered, tortured, and kidnapped rivals, witnesses, and others who opposed the Chapitos.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Other than that, there are no legal ways that he made money, so it's hard to make an estimate of his net worth at the time of writing. However, a $3 million U.S. reward was over his head.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunDA0Z6lnaGenHymuIynoKehXZq2rLWMmqmrnaOpsqU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
