I am not inside the hospital.”</strong></p><p>Harris is reluctant to respond when Tory asks what hospital <a href=#>Megan</a> is being treated at, repeatedly dodging the subject before finally answering, “Cedar.”</p><p>After that, Lanez started apologizing, blaming his behavior on being drunk.</p><p>He continues: <strong>“I ain’t even know what the fuck was goin’ on, like, deadass. I ain’t never do some shit like that. I just… so fuckin’ drunk, nigga, I didn’t even understand what the fuck was going on. Regardless, though, that’s not gonna make anything right, and it’s not gonna make my actions right. I’m just deeply sorry, bruh. I never even move like that. I never move like that at all.”</strong></p><p>Harris lets out a sigh before responding. <strong>“I don’t know. There’s a lot… There’s a lot that happened, but…”</strong></p><p>Lanez interrupts her. <strong>“I feel like I’m going mad. But given the circumstances, I can’t undo what happened, so I’m simply going to say I’m sorry. I believe I was just too inebriated. I can promise you that when I arrived at the residence, the top niggas shot me five times off the door. I had left the area.”</strong></p><p>Later, he acknowledged that he couldn’t remember the specifics of the subsequent argument between Megan, Harris, and himself.</p><p>Harris intervenes. <strong>“I agree, I don’t. By the time you arrived, I was already screwed up.”</strong></p><p>Lanez then idly inquires a third time about the hospital Megan is being treated at.</p><p>She had already told him, Harris responds, before repeating, “Cedar Medical.”</p><p>Again changing the subject, Lanez asks Harris to get in touch with his security so they can figure out how to get him out of jail.&nbsp;</p><p>She responded that to prevent the news from spreading, some people are concerned and interested in seeing him released from custody. She further added that Megan’s staff was already calming the situation down.</p><p>Lanez added that he doesn’t believe Megan will suffer any consequences from the incident and that it will all come back on him.<br>The phone call is then concluded by him remarking, <strong>“No matter if I leave this place today or not, bro, I just wanted to say that I was sorry. If I wasn’t so intoxicated, I wouldn’t have done that thing.”</strong></p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDAzquwZqSRo7K7ecuemKSdlGK9qbvNnmScmZyherW7jKScpauVrnqprdGroKxllqe8rnnJmqClZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
