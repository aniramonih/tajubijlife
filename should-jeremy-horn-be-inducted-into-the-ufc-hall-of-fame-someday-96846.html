The thing is, I'm not sure he'll get it. Sure, his career winning percentage is 77.8%. That's REALLY good. The man has fought in 108 fights and to have that type of win percentage is unreal.<p>However, he has a below .500 UFC record, which would definitely go against him as far as getting consideration goes. Another thing that would be going against him: Almost every single big name he's gone up against, he's lost to. Sure, he beat Chuck Liddell, but that was in Liddell's third career fight. Liddell avenged that loss years later. Horn deserves credit for taking him into the fourth round, especially considering Liddell was in his prime at that point, but the fact remains that he still lost.</p><p>Unfortunately, his losses to bigger names look like this:</p><p>Rousimar Palhares (a middleweight prospect)<br>Nate Marquardt<br>Matt Lindland<br>Chuck Liddell<br>Anderson Silva<br>Babalu Sobral<br>Ricardo Arona (Twice)<br>Elvis Sinosic (I still don't know how he ever got a title shot)<br>Randy Couture<br>Minotauro Nogueira<br>Frank Shamrock</p><p>And those are just the more well known fighters.</p><p>Sure, he's beaten Chuck Liddell, Forrest Griffin, and Chael Sonnen three times, but that was when the former two were still very raw, and Chael Sonnen has never been good until the last couple of years. But I mean, other than that... Gilbert Yvel? Travis Fulton? It just seems that almost every relatively big name he's ever gone up against, he's lost to.</p><p>I'm not going to discredit anything that he's done. He's a very good MMA fighter and he's done a lot for the sport of mixed martial arts. He's also a tough son of a bitch. 108 fights, it's unreal. He has a true passion for the sport too. He said he doesn't care about winning, he just likes to fight more than anything else.</p><p>Unfortunately, his lack of victories over real top talent is probably going to be what hinders his chances at ever being a Hall of Famer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmien6fCrr%2BNsKmeq6Shsru7zZ5lnKedZMGpvsSam6xno528trjDZqGeqpWixm60zqulZpqVYravsNScq56cXZ67tbuMrZ%2BeZaWbsG60wKWjZqeWYrOiucRmqqillZmuunqYb29tbl8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
