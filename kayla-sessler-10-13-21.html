When she first got pregnant, Ryan did wonder if the baby might be his.</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>“I don’t feel like Ryan’s the dad, because if I thought that I would have done that, guys, so long ago,” Kayla said in the promo. “I would have done that as soon as Izaiah was born, ’cause Stephan hasn’t been sh*t from the start.”</p><p>She added that she would have asked Ryan for a paternity test a long time ago if she believed he was the father of her son.</p><p>Kayla then said it was “a little annoying” that he waited four years before asking about Izaiah’s paternity, although she is willing to hear him out.</p><p>“It’s just been something that’s really been on my mind and kind of really bothering me,” Ryan told Kayla on the phone.</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>Despite still struggling with her relationship with her first baby daddy, Kayla soon found herself in a familiar situation: she was pregnant. This time, the baby daddy was a new guy named Luke, and things went differently for Kayla.</p><p>It’s true that she and Luke had their difficulties, but fans seemed relieved that Kayla found someone much more supportive. Now, Kayla’s sharing that he put a ring on it!</p><p>And it is quite the ring!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmusqpjsLC5jqBmpJmpoa5uv8SsqqWdomJ%2BcXmQbGRraV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
