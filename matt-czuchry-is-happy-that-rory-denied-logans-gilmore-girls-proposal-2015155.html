The actor (to much of his fans’ excitement!) recalled his glorious Gilmore Girls days during a <a href=#>Reddit AMA</a> on Monday, May 11.</p><p>But before reminiscing about Logan’s charm and oh, that devilish grin, Czuchry answered a question about his character’s epic proposal. Yes, THAT MOMENT.</p><p>Stars Hollow lovers were left shocked and heartbroken when Rory (<strong>Alexis Bledel</strong>) turned down Logan’s proposal in season 7, which turned out to be the show’s penultimate episode in 2007. But instead of sulking and grabbing pizza, Chinese food, and then some coffee (a la the Gilmore girls themselves), Czuchry admits he actually liked how Rory turned him down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“I feel that the show is about two strong independent women, and that refusal captures the heart of the show. And I don’t think it was personal to Logan. I just think it was the right decision for Rory regardless of who her boyfriend was,” Czuchry, 37, said in the Q&A.</p><p>He added: “Even at the wrap party, there were talks that the show was gonna come back, and that I would have come back to have been a part of that. But nothing was ever set in stone.”</p><p>Indeed, but that wasn’t the worst of it. Gilmore Girls, which ran from 2000 to 2007, was suddenly canceled by The CW after season 7, leaving many questions up in the air. But even so, Czuchry is grateful for the time he did work with the cast — and writers. Rory and Lorelai Gilmore (<strong>Lauren Graham</strong>) had so much dialogue each episode, that scripts were much longer than the average TV series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“The writers did want the material word-perfect,” Czuchry explained to one fan. “The pace of the dialogue was what made that show incredibly unique, and also incredibly difficult as an actor. To be able to maintain that speed, tone, and at the same time, try to make layered choices was a great experience to have early in my career. It really challenged me.”</p><p>The New Hampshire native joined the cast in season 4, with Logan meeting Rory freshman year at Yale University. Logan was a striking contrast to her old hometown boyfriends Dean Forester (<strong>Jared Padalecki</strong>) and Jess Mariano (<strong>Milo Ventimiglia</strong>), which Czuchry actually thinks was good for Richard (the late<strong> Edward Hermann</strong>) and Emily Gilmore’s (<strong>Kelly Bishop</strong>) granddaughter.</p><p>“I looked at Logan as somebody who would challenge Rory,” Czuchry said. “And push her to new adventures in her life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Logan did push Rory, especially in the episode “You Jump, I Jump, Jack,” where they cascaded off a wall with the help of umbrellas. But as it turns out, Czuchry would have been fine if that certain scene was written out!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m terrified of heights in real life, so I would not have done that stunt,” he joked, noting it was one of his favorite episodes nonetheless. “In terms of Logan’s sense of adventure and grand gestures and spontaneity, those are elements that I try to take from him and apply to my own life.”</p><p>As for two other episodes he enjoyed filming? “Wedding Bell Blues” and “Hay Bale Maze” are at the top of his list.</p><p>Before heading out, Czuchry also told fans that he’s without a doubt Team Logan. (Duh!) He even proved just how much he wouldn’t mind working again with “sweetheart” Bledel when he gave out the name of The Good Wife’s casting director. Could Rory be meeting Cary Agos in the near future?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOppitrF2Yx7avx6uwZqGjYrWivM%2ByZK2gkal6s7vRsmSdnZ6esqV5y6iemqajYrSquMyoqZ5ll56%2Frb%2BMqamoqJ%2Borq15kWlobmllag%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
