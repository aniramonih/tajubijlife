But here in the McEnroe family, things were different.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After Jonny got custody of his three kids in 1998, the second marriage was already a year older, and Patty herself was happy with the court’s decision.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>They lived a happy life back then, and as of now, those little John McEnroe kids are already 25 or older, and their life with their parents is on good terms.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>They’re now living their own lives but are still attached to their dad and half-mother.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Also Read:&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Who Are Reggie Bush Parents?
