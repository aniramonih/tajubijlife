I’ve never even sent flowers to it. It’s been almost 12 years now, and I haven’t done it once," he wrote on his Facebook page.<p class=align-left>He explained that he understands people have different ways of coping with grief but revealed that he does not feel the need to because he did everything in his ability for her when she was alive.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Never miss breaking news – join Briefly News' Telegram channel</a></strong></p><p class=align-left>According to him, he showered her with love, took care of her, and gave her flowers while she was still alive.</p>"So to all of you who have mothers on the top side of the soil, it is my hope that you will feel the same sense of peace that I have when that time comes.

Her spirit is with her Lord and Savior. I feel her more spending time in my music room that has her grand piano. I see her hands when I look at my own. I hear her cough and sneeze every time my sister or I cough or sneeze. I hear her voice in my head. Her body may rest in that graveyard but her spirit lives on. I don’t go to her grave. It feels empty there. I find her in odd moments, in quiet moments."<p class=align-left>Charmin Wynette</p>"I can totally identify with you on that because I feel the same way about my mom. 23 yrs later and I have complete peace. It always hurts. I always miss her but do not feel the need to dwell at her resting place because I loved on her while she was here every day."<p class=align-left>Tija Hilton-Phillips</p>"And your mother is not at the cemetery. She is right there with you every single day and always will be with you. You visit with her every day. She is still your biggest supporter. Thank you for loving her while she was here."<p class=align-left>Meanwhile,<strong> Briefly News</strong> previously reported that movie mogul <a href=#>Tyler Perry tipped 42 local Atlanta, US restaurant employees with over R381 000</a> during a visit.</p><p class=align-left>Each restaurant worker was to go home with R9 000 which will go a long way in these tough times.
