The couple celebrated their 31st anniversary in February 2022.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Their relationship has been something he is proud of, and he flaunts it at every chance he gets, especially during their anniversaries.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>According to Campbell, it's the instability in his life that keeps her hooked. And his awesomeness, of course. At least that's what he says. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Bruce Campbell and Wife Ida Celebrate 30+ years together</h2><p>Campbell has never been too keen on sharing much about his personal life. His Instagram posts rarely talk about his family and mostly show him in funny filters.</p><p>But, crossing the 30-year mark with his wife seemed like a special thing to him. He&nbsp;made consecutive posts for two years straight in 2021 and 2022, mentioning his wife and their marriage.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>On February 22, 2021, he penned a sweet, definitely pride-filled post on what was their 30th wedding anniversary. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"2/22 is a special day. It’s when I married this sassy/classy dame, Ida Gearon, 30 years ago," he wrote. Then, he taunted the entire Hollywood and its track record with brief marriages — "Eat it, Hollywood marriages!"</p><p>Accompanying the caption was a blurry picture of the two at some formal event, presumably from a while ago.</p><p>Valentine's Day 2022 provided the <a href=# rel=follow>Evil Dead actor</a> with another opportunity to show off his relationship, albeit he did so more subtly this time around. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Bruce Campbell with his wife of over 30 years, Ida Gearon.</strong> (Photo: Bruce Campbell/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"30+ years with my Valentine, Ida," he wrote, posting an old picture of the couple on a hike. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>A Relationship Predicated on Humor and Privacy</h2><p>Campbell's book,&nbsp;Hail To The Chin: Further Confessions Of A B Movie Actor, came out in 2017, and it immediately caught people's eyes for two reasons — his fine advice about the entertainment industry and a recurring theme about his&nbsp;wife. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The book detailed how she had been at the end of multiple unpleasant experiences beside him. During a sit-down with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Den of Geek</a> in March 2018, he had funny things to say about why his wife had been with him all these years.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>"I put her in the hospital. I almost got her arrested by&nbsp;Bulgarian police! She puts up with a lot of [expletive]," he joked. "It’s just because I’m so dynamic and amazing, it’s really what it is."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>His penchant for danger and uncertainty kept her "coming back for more," the Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness actor quipped. But he was also well aware of how she could be with "some drip, rich&nbsp;attorney, some guy who couldn’t get it up."</p><p>The interviewer kept his&nbsp;humor going, asking if he was "relying on complacency" from his wife.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He disagreed. According to him, it was his "keeping her off balance" that worked on her. She did not like doing the same thing repeatedly, but she then also complained about not having stability.</p><p>And while all these were jokes, the humor might be what ultimately keeps her around. Probably that and their children, of which they have two. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The couple is apparently blessed with a daughter&nbsp;Rebecca Campbell and a son Andy Campbell.</p><p>In his book, he does not reveal many details about his son and daughter, either, but during an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fatherly</a> in August 2017, he talked about the reason why he does not.</p><p>"The reason I don’t is because I am incredible protective of my children," he told Fatherly. "It’s most important to me not to drag them into any kind of publicity that they don’t want."</p><p>He and his wife had created a normal life for them in their childhood, and they did not pursue a career in the entertainment industry after growing up. This, however, did not mean he kept them insulated from the outside world.</p><p>Campbell's father always let his son pursue his interests. He is following in his father's footsteps. "Dogs and children, you gotta let them run," he said during the interview.</p><p>Besides being life partners, Campbell and Ida are also partners in work. By 2018, they had created over a dozen small, independent projects together. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqiqrCmecKapKmalaG5bsPIn5xnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
