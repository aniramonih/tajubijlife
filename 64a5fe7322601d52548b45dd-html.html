Ask any defender who has faced him, and they will most likely admit that the 5-foot-10 wide receiver is the speediest player they've stepped on the field with.</p><p>While <a href=#>Hill</a> doesn't technically have the best 40-yard dash time (that honor belongs to <strong>John Ross</strong> in 2017), his game speed is widely considered to be the fastest of all-time.</p><p>But a former high school cross-country rival of Hill doesn't agree with the general consensus. <strong>Devon Allen</strong>, wide receiver for the <strong>Philadelphia Eagles</strong>, is <strong>crowning himself as the NFL's speed king</strong>.</p><p>I definitely am (the fastest in the NFL). I'm not gonna roast those guys, because what they did is impressive. I raced Tyreek Hill when I was in high school, and he smoked me when we were in high school. And DK (Metcalf) running 10.3 (seconds in a 100-meter dash) a couple years ago is super impressive for a guy who's 6-4, 225. But I think, especially at the top level there's a big gap in terms of performance.</p><span class=ue-c-article__blockquote-author>via TMZ Sports</span><p>Allen believes there are levels to playing football and running track, even though he has admitted that Hill beat him years ago on the track.</p><p>Last month, Allen finished second in the<strong> NYC Grand Prix</strong> in the 110 meters hurdles competition.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>From the Track to the Gridiron</h2><p>He signed with the Eagles in the spring of 2022, but spent all of last season on the team's practice squad. Though he played college football at the<strong> University of Oregon</strong>, Allen was not drafted and shifted his focus to competing in track and field events.</p><p>The 6-foot-1 speedster decided to participate in Oregon's Pro Day in 2022, where he caught the Eagles' attention. He is currently on the Eagles roster, with hopes of getting some playing time in 2023 for the NFC Champions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqedpWdiZX90e49wZmluX2uBooHFnm5samJrfXKwlGtsbXCSaYKlsI2hq6ak</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
