And yet, now that my son is two, I have romanticized those early days so much that I find myself saying the same saccharine oversimplifications which in no way connect to the authentic experience of a wildly nuanced and complex time."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/592000c68c3e-gettyimages-1423264286.jpg><p id=eoo83NsxPS data-wc=42>Meredith, who welcomed her first son in 2021, continued: "I felt so lonely and tired in those early days.
