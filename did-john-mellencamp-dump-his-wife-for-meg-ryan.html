I honestly didn’t remember that they were still together, so I greeted the news with a solid “meh.” <a href=#>According to Us Weekly’s source</a>, “They are both devastated and upset about it, but it was really her decision.” Their official announcement came via John’s rep, though, and it was: “John and Elaine Mellencamp are proud of their 20 years together and are very happy with their accomplishments both as parents and as a family. They will continue to raise their two children in Indiana but have decided to all it a day as a couple.” BUT – what looked like a not-that-scandalous split is starting to look more interesting. A few months ago, there was an odd photo of John and Meg Ryan, sharing a laugh together in New York City (<a href=#>photo here</a>). Now Page Six has brought it up, wondering if Meg is “the other woman” here:</p><p>John Mellencamp, who split with his wife of 18 years, has recently made himself a new friend — Meg Ryan.</p><p>A source tells us the 59-year-old rocker, who this week announced he and his model wife, Elaine Irwin, are splitting up, has struck up a friendship with Ryan, 49. He and Ryan, who had their biggest years in the ’80s, were photographed arm-in-arm walking in TriBeCa in late October, and she has since been spotted backstage at dates on his tour. A source told us, “Meg has been to a couple of recent shows.”</p><p>Mellencamp’s publicist, Bob Merlis, announced on Thursday that he and Irwin had split after 18 years of marriage. He declined to say if they’d filed for divorce, but did say, “They will continue to raise their two children in Indiana but have decided to call it a day as a couple.”</p><p>Merlis, who last month denied to Page Six that Mellencamp was splitting from his wife, last night said he had no further comment. Ryan’s rep didn’t return calls or e-mails.</p><p>Mellencamp became famous in the late ’70s under the stage name John Cougar. His hits include “Jack and Diane” and “Hurts So Good.” He’s now in the middle of a US tour to promote his new album, “No Better Than This,” which continues until April.</p><p>He recently said he was working with producer T Bone Burnett on a musical, “Ghost Brothers of Darkling County,” and Ryan was voicing one of the characters.</p><p>He told the Chicago Tribune: “If you could imagine Tennessee Williams meets Stephen King. They’re recording the dialogue now, and we’re putting out a record of the entire show before it comes out. Right now, Elvis Costello, Meg Ryan, Kris Kristofferson and Matthew McConaughey are doing table readings like an old radio play . . . The CD will come out ahead of time, and then Liv Ullmann will be directing the play.”</p><p>[From <a href=#>Page Six</a>]</p><p>Hm. Sounds like Meg and John are friends. Look, I’m the first one to jump on some piece of juicy “homewrecker” gossip, but I’m just not feeling it with this one. One candid photo a few months ago and some reports that Meg has been to John’s show does not equal an affair, in my opinion. Of course, it could be that I just don’t see what any man sees in Meg Ryan anymore – she looks like twenty kinds of plastic surgery hell. If you’re John Mellencamp and you’re married to a lovely model-type who hasn’t carved up her face, why would you start screwing around with some chick who looks like Meg these days? Ugh.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/wenn5548679.jpg alt=wenn5548679 title=wenn5548679 width=560 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/wenn5195385.jpg alt=wenn5195385 title=wenn5195385 width=560 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmamtjaIJ3e8Oim5iin527oLnEpaOeppOWurGrw66kqZeYnsCgw8ifnJien6esrrHGmKmymZ5k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
