We have compelling evidence, however, that Lamar is not 104—not even close. Here’s how old he really is and who should be recognized as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MCU’s oldest actor</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 data-injectable=false>Leon Lamar: the supposed 104-year-old actor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-2022-09-21T095806.801.jpg><p data-characters=547 data-current-count=847 data-injectable=true>Before we correct this misunderstanding, here is some background. Leon Lamar is based in Georgia and has been acting professionally since 1994. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>, his first pro gig was the TV show In the Heat of the Night. Despite being a late bloomer in the acting field, Lamar has managed to accrue nearly 50 credits, notably American Made, Halt and Catch Fire, Friday Night Lights, and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. In addition to She-Hulk, Lamar recently appeared in Sisters and the Shrink 3, and he’s set to appear in the movie Till.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Leon Lamar’s real age</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/She-Hulk-Leon-Lamar-3.jpg><p data-characters=780 data-current-count=1080 data-injectable=true>The first indication that Lamar’s age is incorrect was simple mathematics. Kat Coiro listed his birthyear as 1919. If Lamar was born in that year, he wouldn’t be 104. He’d be 102 or 103 depending on his birthday. Further skepticism occurred when a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Redditor</a> linked an offender page for Lamar, which derives from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Georgia Bureau of Investigation</a> records that give his birthyear as 1935, which makes him either 86 or 87. A Twitter user claiming to be Lamar’s nephew put his uncle’s birthyear at 1939 and said that he’s 84 (math is hard). “I got off the phone with him [Lamar] earlier after I shared it [the erroneous article],” Lamar’s alleged nephew stated. “He just laughed so it’s whatever but wow lol like 104??”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Guys.. this is my uncle.. he isn’t 104 lol he’s 84 they got his birthday 20 years off.

Government documentation and ostensible familial corroboration revealed what now seems obvious: that Lamar is in his 80s, which is old, but not that old. We don’t know where this misunderstanding originated, but it allows us to recognize Marvel’s true geriatric marvel.</p><h2 id=h-the-actual-oldest-mcu-actor data-injectable=false>The actual oldest MCU actor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-2022-09-21T095223.002.jpg><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true>Although Stan Lee cameoed in the MCU in his mid-90s, he was bested by Dorothy Steel, who filmed her Black Panther: Wakanda Forever part at 95 years old.
