According to TVLine, Amanda Setton is taking over the role of Brook Lynn Ashton. Brook Lynn is the daughter of Ned Quartermaine (Wally Kurth) and Lois Cerullo (Rena Sofer), who gave birth to Brook Lynn back in 1996.</p><p>Brooke Radding portrayed the character before Adrianne Leon, who last played Brook Lynn back in 2011. Now GH is giving Brook Lynn a fresh look through Setton’s upcoming debut. She’ll make her first appearance in Port Charles on November 18, which should bring quite a shock for Ned and Olivia Quartermaine (Lisa LoCicero).</p><p>Ned will battle suspicions on November 19, so it sounds like he’ll wonder about his daughter’s motives. Why has Brook Lynn suddenly decided to make her PC comeback? Is she running from something or does she have another good reason to return? Brook Lynn will probably claim she just wants to catch up and reconnect, but Ned will obviously think there’s more to the story – and there usually is on GH!</p><p>The reaction to this recast announcement has been mixed so far. Some General Hospital fans aren’t thrilled about having another character in the mix when the cast is already pretty large. However, others are embracing the idea of a returning character instead of a completely new one.</p><p>Brook Lynn has family ties and isn’t someone just invented out of the blue. It may be easier for viewers to accept Setton in an established role. As for Setton’s acting credits, she’s no stranger to the soap world. One Life to Live fans will recall Setton’s run as Kimberly Andrews, so she knows her way around the set of a daytime drama!</p><p>Setton has also appeared on shows like The Mindy Project, Gossip Girl, Hawaii Five-0, Blue Bloods and more. It’ll be interesting to see her spin on Brook Lynn and find out what kind of chaos this comeback could bring. Any good return should come with a few secrets and the ability to stir up trouble.</p><p>What do you think about this Brook Lynn Ashton recast? Are you excited to see Amanda Setton take on the role? We’ll give you updates as other GH news comes in.
