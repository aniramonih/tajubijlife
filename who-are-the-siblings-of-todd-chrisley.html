The star of Chrisley Knows Best and his children are the focus of the program, and many TV viewers enjoy watching their family drama.</strong></p><p>But not all dramas are made equal. Todd and his wife Julie Chrisley are a little bit in trouble with the law, but this isn’t the kind of drama you see in reality shows.</p><p>This is a genuine deal; in June 2022, Todd and Julie were charged with 12 counts of bank and wire fraud as well as tax evasion. This has attracted new kinds of attention to his family, particularly his kids.</p><p>Additionally, folks are already looking up Todd’s brothers on the internet to see whether they had anything to do with the legal bind. Here is all the information we have on Todd’s two brothers.</p><h2>The siblings of Todd Chrisley are Randy and Derrick</h2><p>Since Todd’s brothers don’t appear on the show, little is known about them. However, numerous internet sources claim that he had two brothers.</p><p>Todd Chrisley’s younger and only surviving sibling is Randy Chrisley. On August 28, 1970, he allegedly arrived in Westminster, South Carolina.</p><p>Todd and Randy were brought up in Westminster by their mother, Faye Chrisley, together.</p><p>According to some sources, Randy works in the real estate industry, much like his older brother. He hasn’t exactly had much success in the company, though.</p><p>Up until recently, Randy was a married man. In 2010, he began dating Pamela Ann Chrisley, and in 2012, they got married. Their son is a teenager.</p><p>Pamela filed for divorce in the early months of 2016 and accused Randy of adultery on Facebook. But Randy was supported by Todd and his family.</p><p>Then, in March 2016, news emerged that Todd’s sister-in-law Pamela had been detained for intimidating the Chrisley family. She allegedly sought to extort money from Todd since Randy had requested a divorce from her, according to accounts from the time.</p><p>Pamela was arrested and charged with second-degree harassment, but she was released from custody the same day after posting a $1,000 bond. Randy has also run into trouble with the law on a few occasions.</p><p>He was detained on October 30, 2016, for stealing sweets valued at $22 from a South Carolina store. He was caught in the act by the store manager, who then phoned the police.</p><p>Derrick, Todd’s younger brother, was younger than Randy. He is said to have been born on June 19, 1971.</p><p>But several stories claim he passed away after only four months. Derrick’s death is unknown, and Todd has never mentioned him.</p><h2>Randy Chrisley’s Cancer Battle</h2><p>In a November 2014 interview with E! Online, Todd discussed Randy’s cancer diagnosis. Randy, he said, had been given a stage four cancer diagnosis.</p><p>After hearing the news, Todd took a flight back to South Carolina to be with his brother. He immediately transported his brother to a hospital near his home in Atlanta and started his medical care.</p><p>Randy had undergone chemotherapy once and was through his sixth round of radiation treatment at the time of the interview. When Todd shared these facts, he was “pretty knocked out right now with the chemo.”</p><p>Randy was successful in beating cancer after receiving rigorous treatment.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Taylor Kitsch Doesn&#39;t Have Time To Date Or Wed"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/taylor-kitsch-doesnt-have-time-to-date-or-wed/"}{"1":57}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Taylor Kitsch Doesn’t Have Time To Date Or Wed</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity family</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>How Big Is Brian Austin Green’s Family?</a></h3>The first child of Brian Austin Green and Sharna Burgess was just born.
