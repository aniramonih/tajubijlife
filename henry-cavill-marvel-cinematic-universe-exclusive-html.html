While the first Phases of the MCU mostly cast relatively low-profile actors (Robert Downey Jr and Scarlett Johansson aside), the newer slate of movies is more and more casting recognizable superstars. According to our trusted and proven sources, Henry Cavill is the latest actor being wooed to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While we do not yet have confirmation of what role Henry Cavill is in talks for over at Marvel, we have a solid speculation: the head of the First Family,<a href=#> Reed Richards.</a>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/reed-richards-beard-900x506.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/henry-cavill-beard.jpg><p><a href=#>Fantastic Four</a> is one of the more mysterious upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe projects. While the titular team is one of Marvel Comics oldest and most famous teams, there have not yet been any casting announcements who will be playing the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, the Thing, and Mister Fantastic himself, Reed Richards. There is not even a confirmed director since Spider-Man: No Way Home’s Jon Watts departed the project. But we can very much see Henry Cavill as the Marvel Cinematic Universe version of Reed Richards, for a number of reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>For one, Henry Cavill would be a great version of Marvel’s new Reed Richards because he positively radiates reliability and goodness, thanks to his stint as the primary recent DCEU Superman. Clark Kent and Reed Richards are both characters defined in many ways by their fundamental decency; in the same way that Superman is the central overarching figure of DC Comics, Reed Richards is basically the father figure of all of Marvel Comics. Henry Cavill would also be a great pick for the new Marvel version of Reed Richards because we know he can rock some serious facial hair, and that has been an increasingly common look for Mister Fantastic in recent years. Finally, Henry Cavill would be appropriate as Marvel’s Reed Richards because he radiates intelligence as an actor (just think of Geralt of Rivera’s simmering shrewdness or his version of <a href=#>Sherlock Holmes</a>), and the single most important aspect of Mister Fantastic is his brain. Well, that and the whole stretching thing.</p><p>It would also be quite the coup for Disney to bring Henry Cavill over to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is unclear whether Henry Cavill will continue playing <a href=#>Superman</a> over at Warner Bros’ DCEU (or for how long), but it does certainly seem like he is being phased out, possibly to make way for a younger version of the character. Only a few actors have made the leap from one comic book mega-franchise, but Henry Cavill currently has enough star power to make it happen.</p><p><br>Marvel Studios will need to cast some heavy-hitters in Fantastic Four, as it is undoubtedly one of their most anticipated projects in years. Henry Cavill as the new Reed Richards of Marvel Universe-616 would bring a lot of gravitas to the role and the movie, especially if they find someone equally jacked as his old college buddy, Viktor Von Doom.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iglaO%2FunnCmq2ipJxiuqK%2B1Z6jZpuZo7KurdOimmatnp7Dpr7SnmSesJOhwrS11Z5loaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
