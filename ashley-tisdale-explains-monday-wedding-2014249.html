"The 8th was our anniversary so I wanted to land on an 8th, and [thankfully] it landed on a Monday in September."</p><p>For Tisdale, there was a second reason why Monday was the perfect day to get married. "Also, because I figured out like, 'Oh, I don’t think anybody would figure this one out,' and that was to protect the privacy of it," she said.</p><p>Tisdale confirmed she was married via Instagram, calling her nuptials the "Best day of my life!" Her High School Musical costar and best friend <strong><a href=#>Vanessa Hudgens</a></strong> was <a href=#>one of six bridesmaids</a> in the wedding. While <a href=#>enjoying her honeymoon in Bora Bora</a>, Tisdale changed her Twitter name (in the style of <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian West</a></strong>) to reflect her married name: Ashley Tisdale French.</p><p>The former Disney darling and her musician hubby first met in December 2012, and got engaged eight months later on the 103rd floor of the Empire State Building.</p><p>In a December 2013 interview with Seacrest, Tisdale said her story was love at first sight. "I think from the moment that him and I met, I just knew it," she said On Air With Ryan Seacrest. "I was like, 'Ok this is the guy,' and he knew the same thing. It doesn't get any better. I just can't explain it."</p><p>As for newlywed life? Tisdale wrote this past Sunday, Sept. 21, that she and her hubby were marathoning a popular show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Ok so right now all I'm gonna do is curl up on the couch with my husband and get lost in watching….
