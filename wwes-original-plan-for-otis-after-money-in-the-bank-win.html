Then WWE went another direction. The exact wording given to us was: “Otis and briefcase: Who knows?”</p><p>Otis’ Money In The Bank win was supposed to “set him up down the line for The Fiend.” Bray Wyatt has since been transitioned into a multi-match program with Braun Strowman.</p><p>Regarding Tucker, we were told that his entry into the situation was supposed to build toward a “big angle” down the line. A lot of things were in play at the time, but it’s unknown what has changed. Vince McMahon’s constant call for re-writes and changing his mind makes predicting anything impossible.</p><p>Otis is still Mr. Money In The Bank, so they need to do something with him. WWE had much different plans for Otis, but it didn’t materialize.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS.
