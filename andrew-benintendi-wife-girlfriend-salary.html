They attended the same college, the University of Arkansas, and it is possible that this was where they commenced their relationship. That romance continues to wax strong to date, and the two individuals involved are also doing exploits in their professional life.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Andrew Benintendi is a Well-Known MLB Star&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>One thing Andrew Benintendi cannot be categorized as is an ordinary baller. The American professional baseball outfielder plays for the Boston Red Sox of the Major League Baseball (MLB), where he started his professional career following an impressive college career for the Arkansas Razorbacks of the University of Arkansas. He joined the big league after his selection in the first round of the 2015 MLB draft. So far in the game, Andrew Benintendi has been more than impressive, and expectedly, the coming years in the league will see him excel even higher.</p><p>In college, Benintendi was named the SEC Player of the Year, among other milestones, including bagging the title of the National Player of the Year award from Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball, as well as the Dick Howser Trophy and USA Baseball’s Golden Spikes Award. Thus, it didn’t come as a surprise when he made the list of the top prospects for the 2015 Major League Baseball draft. All these milestones brought the spotlight upon him, and as such, his family and personal life details have courted the attention of the public, leading to questions like “Is he married or dating anyone?”.</p><h2><strong>He is Not Married But Has a Girlfriend Named Becca&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2018-03-22-at-2.15.04-PM-1024x755-1-e1641808934606.jpg alt="Andrew Benintendi" width=700 height=516 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He may be a great baseball player who enjoys the perks that come with the spotlight, but this Red Sox outfielder does not like his love life to be in the gossip mill. Thus, gleaning information about his love life is a challenge. But while he wouldn’t discuss who his girlfriend is, he doesn’t mind talking about his family and the way they helped his career grow. One thing is clear, though, he is not married, but he seems to be in a serious relationship.</p><p>The most revealing information the baseball player has shared with the public about his love life is a series of pictures he posted on Instagram to wish his girlfriend a happy 23rd birthday. The first post was shared in March 2018 with the caption “Happy 23rd Babe!! #JordanYear #taken ??” and no further details have been given. He didn’t also deem it important to share her name with curious fans, but this has not stopped the information excavators.</p><h2><strong>Andrew and Becca M</strong><strong>ay Have Been College Sweethearts</strong></h2><p>While Andrew didn’t spill the beans on the identity of the girl who won his heart, social media detectives dug her up and gave her a name – <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Becca Schamel</a>, a St. Louis native. Interestingly, Schamel graduated from the University of Arkansas in 2017, two years after Andrew left the same school to join the big league. This suggests they were college sweethearts or something close.</p><p>Many <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>hearts remain broken</a> as the hunky baseball star seems to be committed to his relationship and has no time for gossip or any other woman.</p><h2><strong>Becca Schamel is a Registered Nurse</strong></h2><p>Her full name is Rebecca Ann Schamel, and she was born in St., Missouri, on March 22, 1995. Her parents are Gail (father) and Kurt Schamel (mother). Becca grew up with two older sisters and a brother identified as Elizabeth, Abigail, and Carter. She played soccer at some point but didn’t pursue a career in sports.</p><p>Before furthering her studies in college, Schamel graduated from Nerinx Hall High School in 2013. She then studied Kinesiology Pre-Professional Major with a Spanish and Biology minor at the University of Arkansas, graduating in 2017. She also attended the Goldfarb School of Nursing at Barnes Jewish College and obtained a Bachelor of Sciences degree in Nursing in 2019.&nbsp;Becca is now a registered nurse and works in the trauma/acute care surgery unit of Barnes-Jewish Hospital</p><h2><strong>Andrew’s Father Played Baseball and Helped Him Practice as a Child</strong></h2><p>Andrew Sebastian Benintendi was born in the city of Cincinnati, Ohio, on July 6, 1994. As the oldest of the three children of his parents, he grew up with two sisters – Olivia and Lily, and they were raised by their parents, identified as Chris, an attorney, and Jill, a homemaker. Notably, Andrew was raised as a Cincinnati Reds fan by parents who were high school and varsity athletes, exposing him to the world of sports from childhood.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Congrats to my mom on her High School HOF induction tonight! She is the real athlete of the family! ????????</p><p>— Andrew Benintendi (@asben16) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">January 20, 2017</a></p><p>Growing up in a home where sports is revered, his athletic aptitude was evident from an early stage. He danced, dabbled in soccer and golf, as well as thrived in basketball and baseball. Though they didn’t really go pro, his father was a baseball player in his heydays, while his mother was also athletic. As a result of his background, Benintendi got baseball lessons from his father, and this helped him a lot. He doesn’t hesitate to share those memories with the public.</p><span class=su-highlight>&nbsp;“We’d always go out back when I was a kid and throw tennis balls,” said Andrew Benintendi to MLB. “He’ll tell you that he was throwing them pretty hard. He would call himself, ‘The Big Texan.’ I don’t know why, but it kind of stuck and he’s been kind of my hitting coach, I guess, growing up. I never really had an instructor or anything.”&nbsp;</span><p>As a student of Madeira High School located in Madeira, Ohio, Benintendi posted records that remained unbeatable. In high school, he played both baseball and basketball and performed remarkably, landing the 2011-12 Cincinnati Enquirer Division III co-Player of the Year in his junior year. His father’s support obviously paid off.</p><h2><strong>Andrew’s Paternal Grandparents Were Italian Immigrants&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Benintendi’s paternal grandparents, Robert, an OB-GYN, and Sally, were originally from Sicily, Italy, from where they immigrated to the United States. Thus, his roots are traceable to Italy. Benintendi’s family, now comprising of his parents Jill and Chris, and a younger sister named Lilly, currently reside in Ohio. The family is pretty close-knit, as revealed by Benintendi; his folks check up on him always. He also gets texts from his uncles and his parents after every game, encouraging him, and these gestures keep him going.</p><p>According to his mother, Andrew is very close to his father, the bond is so strong they don’t go a day without communicating. <span class=su-highlight>&nbsp;“Andrew and I are very close, but those two…What Chris and Andrew have is really, really special.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunCtzZ2pnq9dl7Kvtc2tnKecmWLEqrLEZp6iqpybv6qxzZ1krJmclr%2B6ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
