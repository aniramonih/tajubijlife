The first person to ever receive a key to Inglewood was Insecure star Issa Rae, who received it from then-Mayor Tyra Banks, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>PEOPLE</a>.</p><p>Back in 2020, <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>D Smoke spoke to HipHopDX about his unique style</a>, especially since he’s one of the only non-Latino rappers to rap both in English and in Spanish — and do it so fluently.</p><p><span class=s1><p>AD LOADING...</p></span></p><p>“I think a lot of people rhyme in Spanish because they’re influenced by other Spanish music,” he said. “It’s not the case with me. I’m still diving into Spanish artists and getting exposed to them. There’s a lot of dope stuff out there. What’s primarily influenced my approach to music is literature. A lot of times in Spanish, I’ll tell stories from my perspective without being aware of the trends in Spanish music.”</p><p><span class=s1><p>AD LOADING...</p></span></p><p>He continued: “That’s why people get a lot of the rhyme patterns that primarily come from West Coast Hip Hop. You’re getting my story in Spanish versus without sounding like what’s out. It’s not my first language so much respect to the Latin music that’s happened already and one of those groups that inspired me like this Afro Latinx group from the Bay Area, Los Rakas, who are super dope. They’ve been doing the bilingual thing in both English and Spanish. Their roots are in Panama and Oakland.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mibZqudpLimedKiqWavn6e4brTAq5tmqJyWxm60wKub</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
