As the years passed, he was able to perform at the renowned Just for Laughs Comedy Festival held in Montreal, Canada.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>Look Up Another Comedian:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Chris Redd Net Worth, Married, Family" rel=follow>Chris Redd Net Worth, Married, Family</a></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>The comedian was also the youngest person ever to perform on the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>But he made it into the big spotlight when he not only auditioned but became the runner up of one of the biggest reality talent show called America’s Got Talent (AGT). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>In the show, Taylor first performed a joke about struggling to fit a comforter into a duvet, among other jokes. The judges of the show were so impressed with him that they all voted “yes” and sent him to Vegas.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Though he did not win the first place, winning the second place boosted his career like nothing else.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Other shows that he has appeared are Comedy Central’s Live At Gotham and MTV’s TRL.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Other than his appearance on the national TV, he does frequent tours around the US, making people laugh wherever he goes. As of 2019, he seems to be busy in his nationwide tour that started in January 2019 in LA.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>With so many tours and publicity, he is sure to collect a hefty lump of net worth. But the stand-up comedian opts not to share his total net worth to the public. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Who Is Taylor’s Girlfriend?</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>The question did arise in ones’ mind when a video of Taylor being interviewed was uploaded on YouTube. In the interview for AGT, it was evident that Heidi was dating Taylor. The interview also elaborated on the relationship between the two. Presented in a funny way, the couple seemed like a match made in the stars.</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>Taylor Williamson with supermodel Heidi Klum&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: zimbio.com)</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>By the end of the video, Taylor popped the big question to the supermodel. Yes, the comedian asked Heidi to be his wife. To the question, Heidi surprisingly said yes.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Suddenly, the video revealed that all of it was, in fact, a dream Heidi had. She&nbsp;recalled the whole dream as a nightmare. Poor Taylor!&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>The story is made up as Heidi is already married.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>Know More About Heidi Klum's Real Love:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Tom Kaulitz Girlfriend, Dating, Affair, Married" rel=follow>Tom Kaulitz Girlfriend, Dating, Affair, Married</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>But jokes aside, the comedian seems to be living a low-key life due to which it is hard to say if he is dating or not. Looking at his tweeted photo of him with a monkey in February 2019, however, it could probably mean that he is single. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-631 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZq2ZqaG8s3nWoqOloZGiwLC6jKecrWWnpL%2B1tIywoJ%2BdXam8tr6NoaumpA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
