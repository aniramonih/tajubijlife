As of mid-2016, it is reported to be $60 million, acquired from his years playing in Major League Baseball(MLB), and the sales of his two chart-topping jazz albums.</p><h3>Bernie Williams Net Worth $60 million</h3><p>Born in the Bronx, New York City but raised in Puerto Rico, Williams is the son of Bernabé Williams Figueroa Sr. and Rufina Williams. Growing up, he was a very talented kid who was active in sports and had a knack for music. Before he became a baseball star, Williams was first a track star, even winning medals. He won a couple of titles in the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships in Athletics when he was 15.</p><p>Later on, Williams decided to focus on playing baseball. When he was 15, Roberto Rivera, a scout for the New York Yankees saw his potential despite a perception that he didn’t have any real interest in the sport. After two years, exactly on his 17th birthday, the New York Yankees officially signed him and put him in training in Connecticut; his contract became the start of his professional baseball career and of his net worth.</p><p>After years in the minor leagues, finally in 1991 Williams got his break in the majors. The beginning of his career was rather slow, even the former owner of the Yankees thought of trading him to another team, but eventually Williams improved and helped bring glory to the team.</p><p>Some of the rewards Williams received during his 16 years with the New York Yankees include four World Series Championships, being selected five times as an All-Star, and in 1996 being named the American League Championship Series MVP. He was also a Golden Glove Award winner our times and has won a Silver Slugger Award. His many accolades made him one of the most sought-after baseball players during his time, and also helped increase his wealth.</p><p>After 16 colorful years with the Yankees, Williams retired in 2006. Although not setting any outright records, Bernie’s consistency with the bat was crucial to the Yankees’ success, and much appreciated by the fans. He still made a couple of appearances in other leagues, but he never returned to the Major League Baseball after that.</p><p>Aside from his love for baseball, Williams is also a gifted musician. Ever since he was a kid, he was fond of playing the guitar and he brought this even during his years playing baseball. After his retirement from baseball, he even enrolled at the State University of New York at Purchase to study guitar and composition for a year.</p><p>Williams was able to sign a record deal with MPL Communications, and in 2003 his debut album “The Journey Within” was released. It was followed by another album in 2009 entitled “Moving Forward.” Both of his albums became chart-toppers and one even got nominated for a Latin Grammy Award. He also toured with other artists to promote his music. The success of his albums and tours has also helped in his net worth.</p><p>In 2011, Williams co-wrote a book entitled “Rhythms of the Game: The Link Between Music and Athletic Performance”, sharing the relationship between music and athletic performance.</p><p>In terms of his personal life, Williams has been married since 1990 to Waleska. The couple lives in New York, and together they have three children.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table class=interesting_facts readability=17.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>On May 24, 2015, the New York Yankees retired his #51.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>2</td><td>After his retirement from baseball, he is in his second career, as a classical guitarist.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>3</td><td>In 1999 led the American League in intentional bases on balls (17).</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>4</td><td>In 1998 led the American League in batting average (.339).</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>5</td><td>Made major league debut on 7 July 1991.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>6</td><td>Has three children: Bernie Alexander (b. 23 September 1990), Beatriz Noemi (b. 20 April 1994), and Bianca (b. 14 September 1995)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>7</td><td>Finished 7th in voting for 1998 American League MVP.
