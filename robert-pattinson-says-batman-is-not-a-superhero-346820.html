Pattinson says that whenever someone calls Batman a “superhero” he balks at it.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxz1YdHnGBa/</p><p>“Batman’s not a superhero…Batman’s not a hero. He’s a complicated character. I don’t think I could ever play a real hero — there’s always got to be something a little bit wrong. I think it’s because one of my eyes is smaller than the other,” said Pattinson. “His morality is a little bit off. He’s not the golden boy, unlike almost every other comic-book character.”</p><p>The insane level of fame that Pattinson experienced after playing Edward Cullen in the Twilight Saga is something that most actors don’t achieve, and it didn’t sit well with Pattinson. After the series ended, the actor switched to smaller films and projects like The Lighthouse from Robert Eggers and David Cronenberg’s Cosmopolis.</p><p>Now that he has returned to the world of blockbuster films and is playing one of the most beloved characters in pop culture history, the 33-year-old actor also told Geist that he hopes the fans of DC Comics don’t come at him the way that Twilight fans did a decade ago.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>If Robert Pattinson's <a href=# rel=nofollow>#TheBatman</a> works, Warner Bros. and DC believe the film's villains like Riddler, Penguin or Catwoman could headline their own spinoff movies <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/YYM6NSctLB</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/shqWM2Hc31</a></p><p>— Variety (@Variety) <a href=# rel=nofollow>November 26, 2019</a></p><p>Pattinson says a part of him thinks that it’s impossible for history to repeat itself because what happened with Twilight was so sudden. But, he hopes that fans won’t be hanging out outside his home because he is just “boring and old” now.</p><p>Joining Pattinson in The Batman will be John Turturro as crime boss Carmine Falcone, Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman, and Paul Dano as Riddler. Jeffrey Wright will take on the role of Commissioner Gordon, and Andy Serkis has been cast to play Alfred. There are also rumors swirling that Colin Farrell is in talks to play Penguin.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The Batman is scheduled to hit theaters on June 25, 2021.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeipK%2BmvtNmp5qspJ67tLvNZqqasaNir6LAzJqlZqGjYruwwIyaZKytoJq%2FqbHRqGRsbGZtf3F7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
