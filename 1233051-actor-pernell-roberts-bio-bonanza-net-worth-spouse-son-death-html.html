Although information regarding how the two met remains vague, some reports indicate that they met when Eleanor husband, Thomas Hanna was visiting Roberts’s home for some intellectual discussions. After the meeting, Thomas, Eleanor, and the actor maintained contact. When Thomas died in a tragic road accident, Eleanor continued to have a close relationship with the actor and would often play hostess for gatherings at Roberts’s house. At some point, the two fell in love and decided to tie the knot in 1997. The two did not have a child together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/73bb92e02cbf2336.jpg><h2>Past marriages</h2><p class=align-left>Before marrying Eleanor, Roberts was in three other marriages all of which had been dissolved.

He married his third wife, Kara Knack in 1972 and divorced her 24 years later in 1996.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/73a36b328a8126ef.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Find the answer to "How much is Dave Chappelle worth?" and other top facts about him</span></p></a><h2>Pernell Roberts cause of death</h2><p class=align-left>Is Pernell Roberts still alive? After retiring in the 1990s, the actor was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">diagnosed with pancreatic cancer</a> in 2007 and died two years later in 2010 at the age of 81. An obituary in New York Times misstated act Pernell Roberts cause of death stating it as prostate cancer. His lawyer and longtime friend Richard Stone has since confirmed that the actor died of pancreatic cancer and not prostate cancer as reported.</p><p class=align-left>At his age, the rugged actor who noted that he never regretted leaving the Bonanza outlived the whole Cartwright clan. Dan Blocker passed away in 1972, Lorne Greene — in 1987 while Michael Landon died in 1991. The actor was survived by his fourth wife Eleanor Criswell with who they had no child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d045c422f827efa3.jpg><p class=align-left>Pernell Roberts stands as one of the most successful actors in Hollywood, having made more than 60 appearances on film and TV shows. The natural born Georgia rebel was a man of principle and spent a considerable amount of time-fighting segregation, racism, and sexism. Why Pernell Roberts left <i>Bonanza</i>? He was continually at odds with scriptwriters for his concerns about equality. The American actor was good at keeping away from the public eye. He married four times and had a son with his first wife. The son, however, died in a motorcycle accident and Roberts did not sire any other child in his later marriages.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7774cb069031bc20.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How much is Tyler Perry worth?
