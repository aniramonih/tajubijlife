As fans wait for an update on Reigns’ condition, at least we know that creative will not be affected.</p><p>Roman Reigns <a href=#>was hurt in that SummerSlam match</a>. Naturally, a lot of questions were immediately fired all over social media after that news broke. Reigns is still the top name in WWE, and he brings a ton of attention to every step of the Bloodline’s saga.</p><p><a href=#>We previously reported that WWE wasn’t talking about Roman Reigns’ injury status. </a>At this time, we are still missing some important details about what is really going on.</p><p><a href=#>Ringside News</a> asked around about this, and we were told by a tenured member of the creative team that, “Roman is injured, but it won’t change any plans.” It seems that whatever is wrong with the Tribal Chief won’t cost him any future matches they have planned.</p><p>That being said, Roman Reigns is not dropping his titles over this. He is still the Undisputed Universal Champion, and the <a href=#>Bloodline saga is still in the bottom of the 3rd inning.</a></p><p>Roman Reigns works an ultimate part-time schedule at this point. That being said, we don’t even know when his next match will be. So, he has time to heal up from whatever is bothering him.</p><p>It was said that Roman Reigns suffered his current physical setback early on in his SummerSlam match with Jey Uso. Still, the Head of the Table carried on with the match as planned. <a href=#>Jey Uso winning that match was never the plan at any time</a>.</p><p>What’s your take on Roman Reigns’ injury status?

These two things drive me. Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX90e49xZmlxX6e8rq3NZqmeoZejwG61zaOsq7FdrLatuIynpq1lk52ur7PEZq6wnV2Yv6at06KtnmWgoa6vv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
