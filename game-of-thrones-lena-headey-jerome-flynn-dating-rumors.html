There was reportedly tension on set for a few years, all due to an alleged romance between two of the actors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Sun</a>, Lena Headey (who plays Cersei Lannister on the show) and Jerome Flynn (Bronn) were dating, and Headey refused to be in scenes with Flynn due to a "bitter real-life split."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Lena and Jerome have not filmed together due to a bad break-up," a source told The Sun. "They kept the full extent of it secret but it was a very turbulent relationship and it has been very awkward on set."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Awkward" seems like an understatement, though, because the source went on to say that "Lena has opened up to her trusted friends. She appears to have a genuine hate towards him.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yikes.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dominik Bindl/Getty Images, Taylor Hill/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the show, their characters become linked in the same plot when Bronn is hired by the Lannisters, but Cersei and Bronn never appear in the same shot together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Headey and Flynn acted opposite each other in a few episodes of a British TV series called Soldier Soldier, though The Sun traces their relationship back to 2002, and reports that Headey ended their relationship in 2014. Flynn's spokesman denied it was in his contract that he and Lena were kept apart, though a GoT crew member told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Telegraph</a> in 2014 that “Jerome and Lena aren’t on speaking terms any more and they are never in the same room at the same time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s a pity because they appeared to have patched things up for a while, but now the word is they should be kept apart at all costs," the crew member said at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At least now the show — and any possible awkward interactions with an ex — is behind us all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeXlrqmec6fZK2goqS7pr%2BMpZynmV2dsqKwxLJko52ipLqmecWlsKemXZmutbXNoGSrrZ2kv7Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
