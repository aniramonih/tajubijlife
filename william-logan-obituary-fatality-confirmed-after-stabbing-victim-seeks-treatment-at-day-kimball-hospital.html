When the individual was evaluated, it was determined that the person had died from their injuries. A victim of a stabbing was brought to Day Kimball Hospital on Tuesday, September 26, at approximately 2:45 p.m., according to a report that came into the Putnam Emergency Dispatch Center from the Day Kimball Hospital Public Safety Department.</p><p>The on-scene investigation indicated that a car dropped off William Logan, 51 years old, of New Haven with a life-threatening stab wound at Day Kimball, where he entered the hospital seeking medical attention. The inquiry also revealed that the vehicle was driven by an unknown individual. Treatment that saved the patient’s life was administered by the doctors and nurses working at Day Kimball Hospital. Sadly, the victim did not survive his injuries and passed away.</p><p>The Eastern District Major Crime Squad has assumed control of the investigation into the stabbing that took place on Wednesday morning after the State Police confirmed to WINY that the incident occurred outside of the jurisdiction of the Putnam Police Department. According to the police, there does not appear to be any danger to the general population.</p><p>When WINY arrived to the scene on Tuesday afternoon, sections of the hospital campus had been cordoned off with tape. Day Kimball has communicated that it is appreciative of the help from the local law enforcement officials; however, because this is an ongoing criminal investigation, the hospital is unable to speak any further.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZMSquMuimKZlnKS0orqMqJmirKWWv7p5xZqrmqSZqcZur86nnaKqnZqxbq3FrZyrZaOprqOuyKeeZq6ZmMGquYysnJ6jo2LBs7HAraSepqRirrV5w5qwZqOZoq%2BiuMtmn6iroJ7BoriO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
