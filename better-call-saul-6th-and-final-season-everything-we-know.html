The sixth and final season of Better Call Saul will finally reveal how the kind, but conflicted lawyer Jimmy McGill (<a href=#><strong>Bob Odenkirk</strong></a>) became the morally challenged <a href=#>criminal attorney Saul Goodman</a>.</p><p>“From day one of Better Call Saul, my dream was to tell the complete story of our complicated and compromised hero, Jimmy McGill — now AMC and Sony are making that dream come true,” showrunner <a href=#><strong>Peter Gould</strong> said in a statement</a> in 2021. “We couldn’t be more grateful to the fans and critics who are making this journey possible. Next month, we start work on the sixth and final season — we’re going to do our damnedest to stick the landing.”</p><p>For five seasons, fans have watched as Jimmy teetered on the edge of good and evil, while slowly transforming into the <a href=#>Breaking Bad</a> character viewers love to hate. Come Monday, April 18, the beginning of the end of the AMC prequel will unfold.</p><p>The final season, however, didn’t come to fruition without a few setbacks. In July 2021, <a href=#>Odenkirk was hospitalized</a> after collapsing on set in New Mexico. It was later revealed that <a href=#>he suffered a heart attack</a>, but by September of that year he was healthy and ready to return to set.</p><p>“Back to work on Better Call Saul! So happy to be here and living this specific life surrounded by such good people,” the actor tweeted at the time,<a href=#> sharing a photo of himself in the makeup trailer</a>. “BTW this is makeup pro Cheri Montesanto making me not ugly for shooting!”</p><p>In addition to telling Jimmy’s story in season 6, Breaking Bad fans will finally get to see <a href=#><strong>Aaron Paul</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Bryan Cranston</strong></a> reunited with Odenkirk — but how and when they’ll make their cameos is still a mystery.</p><p></p><p>“I would be in it if <strong>Vince Gilligan</strong> and Peter Gould, who are co-executive producers on it, wanted me to be in it,” Cranston told Collider in April 2020 <a href=#>of his willingness to do a guest spot</a>. “I would do it in a second. But it hasn’t happened yet, I can tell you, and we’ll see. I don’t know. There’s one more season to go, and we’ll see what happens.”</p><p>One year later, Better Call Saul creator Gilligan teased the return of Paul as Jesse Pinkman and Cranston as Walter White, ahead of the season 6 premiere.</p><p>“These two worlds cross over in a way that you haven’t seen before, that’s for sure,” Gilligan told <a href=#>Variety</a> in April. “It would be a damn shame if the show ended without [Cranston and Paul] appearing, would it not?”</p><p>Gould, for his part, <a href=#>confirmed the cameos</a> during PaleyFest on Tuesday, April 11, but wouldn’t say how Cranston and Paul’s characters would be introduced into the prequel series.</p><p>Odenkirk hinted that his character’s connection to both fandoms will be a big part of the farewell season.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I personally feel that the two shows — <a href=#>Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul</a> — are entwined even more than ever in the final season,” he told Variety in April. “And I think that’s surprising and cool, and it’s gonna make you want to watch Breaking Bad again.”</p><p>Scroll down for everything to know about Better Call Saul season 6:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXsrXAxKtknJmcoXq0rdSlZG%2BsmGKur7CMn6CnmZxiwKat0qilZp2mmr%2B6wMeipaBlp5p6rLrOsGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
