2021年2月13日の放送では、ある大学生が夜中に車を走らせてた際に、ヤンキーの男性2人組に車を蹴られ罵られるという事件があったことを配信しました。
普通だったら警察に相談して解決する問題だと思いますが、なぜ配信者のコレコレさんに報告したのでしょうか？
コレコレの動画の中では大学生のドラレコに収録された土方系ヤンキー二人の姿がバッチリ映っており、警察も動きやすい案件だと思われました。
放送の中で神奈川警察が対応をしてくれなかったことが発覚すると、警察に対して揶揄する意見が多く出ました。
[ドラレコ動画]神奈川湘南台で大学生の車がヤンキー二人組に蹴られる 13日にコレコレが動画の中で事件の一部始終をアップすると、すぐにツイッター上で話題になりました。
すでに車をボコボコにした二人組の姿はネット上で拡散されている状態です。

— まーたん@おじさんフェチ (@oshiri_pudding) February 13, 2021 Twitterなどでは警察の対応の悪さとヤンキー２人組への怒りの声が多く出てます。
コレコレ配信に登場した湘南台の2人組の顔と名前の特定 すでにネット上では2人組の特定が始まってします。
コレコレの動画の中での2人組にはモザイクがかかっていますが、かなり特徴的な顔なので特定しやすそうです。
神奈川に住んでる方である可能性が高いですが、警察よりも先にネットで話題になっちゃいそうですね。
少し前のイオンスタイル板橋のカート落下事件のように、間違った人が特定されて傷つけられるパターンはやめて欲しいですが。
被害額は６０万以上。二人組が逮捕された場合[器物損害] 煽り運転で相手の事故の誘導し、さらには車から降りてきて罵倒し車を蹴るという行為。
大学生の車はしっかりと傷がつき、被害額は50万を超えたそうです。
謝っている相手に対して、外から蹴り続け、車をボコボコに・・・・。相手に恐怖を与えたということまで考えると、かなり悪質な事件だといえます。
警察が動いてくれないことに対して、ネットで炎上してしまうのも無理ないですね・・・。
被害を受けた大学生の子は、自分身バレや仕返しが怖いとしながらも、勇気出してコレコレさんに事件のことを伝えました。
被害者のドラレコには犯人の顔も、車のナンバーも映っているので普通に調査してくれたら逮捕できるはずですが・・・。
車の被害者の大学生は慶應(SFC)の子？どこだ また、被害にあった大学生の子がどういう子なのか気になる方もいるみたいです。
本当に相手に対して何もしてないのか、一部始終だけで１０００%被害者だと断定して良いのか、警察が動いてくれなかっただけに、そこが気になる人もいるみたいです。
ちなみにコレコレに通報した大学生が通っている大学を慶應の藤沢キャンパスだと憶測する声があります’。
あの辺りの大学といえば、確かに慶應のSFCか湘南工科大学ぐらいですもんね。
これちらの方はあまり特定しても意味がないので、個人情報を出すのはやめておきましょう。
ヤンキー二人に絡まれた場所は湘南台でも治安の悪いところ コレコレさんの放送を見ていると、この事件の現場の近くに住んでいる方からの書き込みがありました。
どうやら、大学生の子がヤンキーに絡まれた場所は湘南台の中でも治安の悪い場所のようです。
湘南台で物件を探してみると、一部の地域だけ極端に家賃が安いエリアがあります。大学生の子がヤンキーに絡まれた場所も、きっとそのエリアの近所であることでしょう。
地上波のテレビニュースではクラクションが原因と放送 コレコレさんの動画から事件が拡散されると、その数日後に地上波のテレビニュースでも扱われました。
放送された番組は「とくダネ」だったのですが、その放送内容にて、大学生の子にも非があるような伝え方がされたのです。
「きっかけはクラクッションか」という表記があるように、ニュースでは大学生の子のクラクションがヤンキー2人組の怒りを買ったような伝え方をしたのです。
この内容を巡って「それはないだろう！」という意見もあれば、「ちょっと納得」という意見もあるのです。
コレコレさんの動画の中に出てきたドラレコの内容をよくみると、大学生の子が2人組に「ごめんなさい」「本当にすみません」と謝っていることがわかります。
仮に自分が全く悪くないのであれば、あそこまで謝罪を連語することはないというところで、大学生の子も相手の怒りに拍車をかけてしまったのは事実かもしれません。
神奈川県警の対応に対する偏見。無能、税金泥棒は言い過ぎ？ このコレコレの放送をきっかけに、ネット上では車を傷つけられた被害者への同情の声が多く出てます。</description></item><item><title>9/4 WWE Raw Preview: Monstrous Steel Cage Match, Jeff Hardy Battles For The Intercontinental Title &amp;amp;</title><link>/880667-94-wwe-raw-preview-monstrous-steel-cage-match-jeff-hardy-battles-for-the-intercontinental-title-wz-live-coverage-info.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/880667-94-wwe-raw-preview-monstrous-steel-cage-match-jeff-hardy-battles-for-the-intercontinental-title-wz-live-coverage-info.html</guid><description>WWE Monday Night Raw is live from the Century Link Center in Omaha tonight, on a special Labor Day edition of the show featuring a monstrous steel cage match, Jeff Hardy returning to singles competition in a big Intercontinental Championship match, and a whole lot more.
