The couple went on to have two sons together. Sadly, the marriage wasn't destined to be a long-lasting one. By late 2012, their relationship had run its course; writing in a <a href=#>blog post</a> for her Kveller website, Bialik announced that she and Stone, after much soul searching, had decided it was time to go their separate ways.&nbsp;"Divorce is terribly sad, painful, and incomprehensible for children,"&nbsp;she wrote.&nbsp;"It is not something we have decided lightly."
