Their 16-year union broke down just two years after he allegedly fell in love with 28-year-old pop star Houston -- both in the 1992 blockbuster and off-screen.</p><p><strong>RELATED NEWS</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Kevin Costner's divorce sparks rumors of him quitting 'Yellowstone' to save his marriage</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Kevin Costner's real estate portfolio: Newly single actor owns $145M beachfront property in California</a></p><p>Speaking to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Radar Online</a>, sources said it was love at first sight for Costner and Houston when they met on the sets of the film, which features the actor as the bodyguard of the singer's pop star character. The pair shared several intimate scenes in the movie.&nbsp; "He couldn't keep his eyes off her and made her comfortable in her first film role," an insider told the outlet, adding, "The chemistry between them was immediate and powerful."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/f39dee66-536e-45d9-9f1d-931b6661b49b.png><p>Sources claimed that Houston was set to wed pop star Bobby Brown at the time and so she ended her romance with Costner when the film wrapped. Meanwhile, Costner insisted his marriage to college sweetheart Silva was already broken beyond repair when he signed on for the film. As noted by Radar Online, it wasn't his "forbidden pining" for Houston that ended his first marriage.</p><p>In a statement at the time of Houston's death in February 2012, Costner called her his "one true love." And in an interview later that year, the actor candidly opened up about the letters he used to write to her, hoping they would give her support to fight her addiction, per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Smooth Radio</a>. "We both grew up in a Baptist church. It was easy for us to laugh," Costner recalled at Whitney's funeral in 2012, adding, "I can see her in my own mind running around here as a skinny little girl knowing everyone, everyone's business, knowing every inch of this place. I can also see her in trouble, too."</p><p><a href=# rel>MEAWW</a> previously reported how Costner lost $80M to his ex-wife Cindy after reports that he invited an <a href=# rel>exotic hula dancer</a> to perform a private show while filming a movie in Hawaii, a rumor he has strongly denied. However, the actor fortified his finances before his second marriage, when he had Christine Baumgartner sign a prenup before their 2004 wedding, thereby protecting his $250M fortune. Baumgartner filed for divorce this week citing "irreconcilable differences."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/8e25b3be-6795-469d-9592-363a5f1be00b.1388453030><p>Costner and Baumgartner share three children of ages 12, 14, and 15. Both the exes are seeking joint custody of the children. Costner's rep confirmed the divorce to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TMZ</a>, saying, "It is with great sadness that circumstances beyond his control have transpired which have resulted in Mr. Costner having to participate in a dissolution of marriage action."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5iewa%2Bx2GafqK2jqbyvedaio6VllqS%2FpsLEq2SbnV2gsre1zWaaqKuko7Kzv4yopZ5lpKfCpnnLqK2e</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
