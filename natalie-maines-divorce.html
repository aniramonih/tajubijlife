One of the contentious issues was the monthly financial support Adrian Pasdar requested.</p><p>At one point, he asked the court to compel Maines to pay him a monthly sum of $60,000, which included $44,076 for spousal support and an additional $16,427 for child support, totaling $60,503 each month.</p><h2>Financial Claims and Community Property in California</h2><p>During the two-year legal battle, Pasdar claimed that Natalie Maines was extremely wealthy, earning approximately $2 million annually from her music career.</p><p>He also alleged that she had a net worth of $50 million and owned property worth $4.5 million. Pasdar argued that Maines had been the primary breadwinner during their marriage, and, in California, where they lived, money earned during a marriage is considered “community property.”</p><p>Consequently, he contended that Maines should be responsible for covering various expenses, including the mortgage, household expenses, and a vacation home.</p><h2><strong>Prenuptial Agreement in Question</strong></h2><p>A significant point of contention revolved around the prenuptial agreement they had signed before their marriage in 2000.</p><p>Maines asserted that both parties had willingly signed the prenup, which safeguarded her Dixie Chicks’ earnings as her own. Pasdar, however, challenged the validity of this agreement.</p><h2>Settlement Agreement and Division of Finances</h2><p>Despite the prolonged legal dispute, the couple eventually reached a private settlement in October. While the specifics of the settlement remain undisclosed to the public, it presumably involved an equitable division of their finances, along with arrangements for child support.</p><h2><strong>Moving On</strong></h2><p>With the divorce judgment now official, both Natalie Maines and <a href=# rel=noopener>Adrian Pasdar</a> are free to pursue new relationships or life paths, closing the chapter on their turbulent legal battle.</p><p>If you want to stay up-to-date with the latest celebrity news, including divorce revelations and more, <a href=# rel=noopener>follow us on Twitter</a> for the latest updates and exclusive content.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdgbnxzgI6nmK2ZnJ6ybrnAoqWeq12Ztre70ZycaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
