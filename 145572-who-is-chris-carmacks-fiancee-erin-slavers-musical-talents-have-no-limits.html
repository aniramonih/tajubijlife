On Tuesday, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>his now fiancée, Erin Slaver</a>, announced the news through Instagram by sharing an adorable photo of the two celebrating their happiness with some champagne. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Slaver appears giddy about being engaged to Carmack</a>, as she tweeted Tuesday, "Wow, thanks everyone for all the love! I'm overwhelmed with happiness from your kind thoughts!" The actor is no stranger to the spotlight — especially after playing Will Lexington on <i>Nashville</i> and Luke Ward on <i>The O.C. </i>— but let's get to know <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>his bride-to-be</a>.</p><p>Like Carmack's character on Nashville, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Slaver is no stranger to the world of music</a>. According to her official website, she is a quintuple threat. That's right, her talents extend beyond just being a triple threat. Are you ready for this? Slaver is an actor, violinist, fiddler, songwriter, and vocalist.</p><p>Her resume for each vocation is beyond impressive. For example, when it comes to acting, Slaver starred in Seasons 1 and 2 of <i>Nashville</i> (hmm... is that where she met Carmack?) as <a href=# class=T3D>Juliette Barnes' (Hayden Panettiere) backup singer</a>. She's even been featured in a bunch of plays and also in two country music videos, including Sara Evans' "Slow Me Down" and Lonestar's "Maybe Someday."</p><p>Per her biography, Slaver's also toured with country star Trace Adkins and was even a backup artist for Rod Stewart, Rascal Flatts, Keith Urban, and Kelly Clarkson. Clearly she's making a name for herself. With that, let's get to know her a bit better.</p><h3>Here Is An Original Song By Erin</h3><p></p><p>Do you think she and Chris serenade one another?</p><h3>Here Is Erin Playing On Stage With Chris</h3><p>What better way to celebrate the Grand Ole Opry's 90th than with your significant other?</p><h3>Here They Are Being Adorable</h3><p>No wonder they're engaged.</p><h3>Here She Is Playing Hard</h3><p>Get it.</p><h3>Here She Is In Lonestar's Music Video</h3><p></p><p>FYI, she's the violinist.</p><p>Well, Carmack is definitely marrying someone whose musical talent knows no bounds.
