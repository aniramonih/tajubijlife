Fans are unsure whether the news of the rapper’s arrest that has just been spread over social media platforms is accurate. At the time of writing, no real or verifiable information has been disclosed. The rapper’s incarceration has, nevertheless, been the subject of several YouTube channels’ recordings.</p><p>However, a D.C. Artists LLC Instagram account has also claimed that Glizzy was detained on March 8, 2023, in Maryland before being moved to Virginia.</p><p>One person said it was all a PR gimmick for YouTube videos in the comments area. The rapper also posted a tale on Instagram with the caption, “Free me; I’ll be home soon.” That indicates that Glizzy has been held captive. Now that that has happened, many are wondering why he was arrested.</p><h2><span id=What_was_rapper_Ant_Glizzy_from_DC_up_to>What was rapper Ant Glizzy from DC up to?</span></h2><p>We don’t know why Ant Glizzy was jailed since the formal announcement surrounding his arrest hasn’t been released. At the time of this article, there are no details on the rapper’s accusations. In the meanwhile, social media is flooded with outdated YouTube videos. According to the report, the video was made in 2019.</p><p>In the video, Ant Glizzy is seen conversing with police officers while shackled on the ground. According to the Dmv Glo YouTube channel, MPD and Housing allegedly took Glizzy from his residence and put him under arrest. Additionally, Glizzy was hounded and wrongly accused of having an arrest warrant, among other things. Soon, we’ll provide you with some updates on his most recent news.</p><h2><span id=An_explanation_of_Ant_Glizzy8217s_dispute_with_his_brother_Shy_Glizzy>An explanation of Ant Glizzy’s dispute with his brother Shy Glizzy</span></h2><p>On February 28, 1992, in Washington, DC, Ant Glizzy was born to his parents. When he was just 19 years old, his father allegedly was shot and died. Glizzy has a mother called Barbara Amonte, and he has a close relationship with her. In addition, Marquis Amonte is Glizzy’s other sibling.</p><p>The Amonte brothers are just 10 months apart in age, and they both learned to rap as children. Later, Ant’s brother decided on the stage name Shy Glizzy and started rapping. When the Glizzy brothers got into an argument, it made headlines.</p><p>Anger developed between the Glizzy brothers Ant and Shy after Shy declined Ant’s request to be in his song and then declined to appear in Ant’s music video. After starting his own record company, Glizzy Gang, Shy has subsequently recorded several records that have helped him overtake Ant in the music business.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Viggo Sorensen</a>, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Avivasofia</a>, and <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Giselle Guilmette</a>.</strong></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Rapper</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Who Is Indya Moore?
