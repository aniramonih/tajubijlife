A member of the California Science Teachers Association, she works at Encinal Junior and High School, a grades 6-12 institution located on Alameda Island, in the San Francisco Bay. The school has been featured on several MythBusters episodes, particularly the swimming pool and football field. The show even held an event at the school to raise funds in 2006.</p><p>As co-host <a href=#>Adam Savage</a> told&nbsp;The Sneeze, Eileen ended up helping Jamie with a part of fame that he first found it difficult to accept.

It's okay if it's a man." After her advice, Jamie got over the short-lived bout of homophobia and was more relaxed about that aspect of his newfound fame.</p><p>The couple doesn't say much about their private life, even keeping some things from Adam. "But she's a great lady," Savage said. "She's really awesome."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bk25wa29fqbWmedSnnLGolZjBprCMsJiyZZ2uwamu1KyrnqqjYreiucieZKGxnpq6orqMppytZZiewG7DyJ%2BcaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
