She was spotted and signed by Warner Bros. after a casting agent watched her performance in a showcase.</p><p class=Zg>During the first two years of her career, she got almost no speaking roles and was usually cast as an extra. She has been quoted saying that the "failure" had been a good thing. Part of her quote <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0676688/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">reads</a>:</p><p class=Zg>"The best thing that ever happened to me was being a failure during my first two years on the screen.
