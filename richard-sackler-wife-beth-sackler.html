Richard is married to Beth Sackler, but sadly, they are no longer together. The Richard and Beth Sackler Foundation is one of their charitable organizations. Since 2013, he has been living outside Austin, Texas.</p><p>Richard Sackler is an American billionaire businessman and physician who was the chairman and president of Purdue Pharma, a company best known as the developer of OxyContin, whose connection to the opioid epidemic in the United States was the subject of multiple lawsuits and fines.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-richard-sackler-biography><strong>Richard Sackler biography</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Sackler, the son of Beverly (Feldman) and Raymond Sackler, was born in Roslyn, New York, in 1945. He graduated from Columbia College with a bachelor’s degree before attending the New York University School of Medicine to earn an MD.</p><p>Sackler began working for Purdue Pharma in 1971 as his father’s assistant in the president’s office.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>He was appointed director of marketing and director of research and development. Sackler had a significant role in the development of Oxycontin since his research at Purdue Pharma in the 1990s compelled the company to replace MS Contin, which was poised to face generic competition, with Oxycontin. J. Sackler and Russell Portenoy were also recruited by Sackler.</p><p>David Haddox started promoting a new theory that claimed opioids were not very addictive by working inside the medical community.</p><p>Sackler was successful in getting the FDA to approve Oxycontin’s claim that it was less addictive than other painkillers in 1995, despite the fact that no research on its addictiveness or likelihood of abuse had been done as part of the approval process. Opioids’ addictive qualities have long been understood.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-happen-to-richard-sackler><strong>What happen to Richard Sackler?</strong></h2><p>Dr. Richard Sackler, a former president and co-chairman of the board of directors of Purdue Pharma, the prescription opioid manufacturer established by Sackler family members, testified in federal bankruptcy court for around three hours.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Dr. Sackler reportedly responded to inquiries regarding the family’s opioid business in open court for the first time. Dr. Sackler provided his legal team testimony that was primarily pocked with hazy or absent recollections, brief comments, and deflections, much like a lengthy deposition he gave to Kentucky state attorneys in 2015. He frequently apologized for having laryngitis and appeared to occasionally struggle with the technology, which posed frustrating difficulties with the volume of his voice and with the opening of emails that were sent to him while he testified.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-richard-sackler-wife-beth-sackler><strong>Richard Sackler wife, Beth Sackler?</strong></h2><p><strong>Richard Sackler is married to Beth Sackler </strong>Sadly, Beth and Richard Sackler are not together after their divorce.
