From its memorable one-liners and exciting fight sequences, this film has captured audiences’ hearts since it first released back in 1993. Now in 2023, audiences are poised to welcome back yet another version of this timeless masterpiece! Here’s everything we know about the upcoming Road House remake.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When and Where Is Road House Releasing?</h2><p>The new Road House movie is being produced by Amazon Studios, with a release expected in the second half of 2023. Although there isn’t a confirmed release date, reports suggest that the movie will debut as an exclusive on Prime Video. The originality and cult status of the 1989 version sets a high bar, but the remake has potential. For die-hard fans and newcomers alike, this Amazon exclusive could be a much-needed breath of fresh air in the streaming giant’s lineup.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is There a Trailer for Road House?</h2><p>As of now, there’s no official trailer for the Road House remake. However, a tantalizing preview of what’s to come was shown at the March 3, UFC 285 event in Las Vegas. Jake Gyllenhaal made a surprise appearance, in character, taking part in a ceremonial weigh-in for a fictional fight. The crowd at the MGM Grand was treated to a filmed fight scene during intermission, adding to the excitement and anticipation for the film.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What’s the Plot of Road House About?</h2><p>The Road House remake takes the story to a new location: the Florida Keys. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as James Dalton, a former UFC fighter hired as a bouncer at a rowdy bar. The updated story promises to dive into Dalton’s new life, as he finds that things in this tropical paradise aren’t always what they seem. Expect a blend of action, intrigue, and character development in this updated take on the classic story.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who’s in the Cast of Road House?</h2><p>The remake stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Elwood Dalton, a change from the original’s James Dalton. Gyllenhaal first gained recognition through films such as “Brokeback Mountain” and “Donnie Darko.” As co-stars in this role will join Daniela Melchior from “The Suicide Squad” as well as Joaquim de Almedia from Fast Five fame to round out this actor’s performance. Other notable cast members include Billy Magnussen, Lukas Gage, Darren Barnett, Beau Knapp, and UFC superstar Conor McGregor in an undisclosed role.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Are the Creatives Behind Road House?</h2><p>Director Doug Liman, known for hits like “The Bourne Identity” and “Edge of Tomorrow,” takes the helm of the Road House remake. With Joel Silver as the producer and Henry Braham as the cinematographer, the creative team has some serious industry clout. The script comes from Anthony Bagarozzi and Chuck Mondry, who previously worked on “The Nice Guys,” promising a potentially fresh and thrilling adaptation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Has there been a remake of Road House?</h2><p>Before this upcoming release, there was a 2015 attempt to remake Road House with former UFC star Ronda Rousey in the lead role. The project also had Nick Cassavetes attached to write and direct. Unfortunately, like Rousey’s UFC career post-Holly Holm, the remake never materialized. This adds an extra layer of anticipation and curiosity for the new 2023 remake. Will it live up to the original or suffer the same fate as the aborted Rousey project?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>The Road House remake brings together an intriguing mix of old and new, featuring a talented cast and creative team. Although fans of the original may be skeptical, the fresh twists and high-caliber talent involved offer hope that the 2023 version will carve out its own identity while honoring the spirit of the 1989 classic. With no official trailer yet, the hype continues to build, making this one of the most awaited releases of the year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbjAp5ylpJmdsrOty51lnKedZH93fZZoqaiZlJ28tr%2FEZqmepZGgsm6%2BxKWcmquVYrGiwMRmmpqrpGK9rbvTZqmepJWWwKZ5w5qrnmWRo7FusdWeqbKsmJ67qHnYqKxmr5GjwW7Azmaip6enZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
