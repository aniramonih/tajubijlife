Harry's never going to go for this." Sure enough, when she approached him with the idea, he told her he would file for divorce and left the room. Rinna continued, "He comes back to me in like two days and he said, 'You know, I've thought about it, I've done some research ... I changed my mind. I think it might be a good thing for you.'"</p><p>For his part, Hamlin admitted on a 2019 episode of <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live</a>&nbsp;that he told Rinna he had his "divorce lawyer on [his] speed dial" when she expressed interest in the Bravo reality series. He also told Andy Cohen that Rinna suggested he speak with <a href=#>The Real Housewives of New York City's Bethenny Frankel</a> about the franchise and the business opportunities it can offer, adding, "So I did, and here we are."</p><p>But&nbsp;RHOBH is not the couple's first reality show rodeo. Rinna was a contestant on the second season of <a href=#>Dancing with the Stars</a>, and in 2010, Rinna, Hamlin, and their daughters, Delilah Belle Hamlin and Amelia Gray Hamlin, were all on a TV Land reality series called <a href=#>Harry Loves Lisa</a>. As far as the reality TV genre goes, Rinna <a href=#>owns it, baby</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2tia4Z6e9KtqZqml5p6tbTIp56sZZGXvLbAjKGYq6qpYrWiucuipWaZnpl6rbXSmmSroZ6jrrR5zJqpq6GRnLJw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
