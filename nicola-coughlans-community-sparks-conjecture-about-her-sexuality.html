She is recognized as Clare Devlin in the Channel 4 sitcom ‘Derry Girls,’ and she has also appeared in Netflix’s acclaimed period drama ‘Bridgerton.’ Nicola, 35, has achieved tremendous professional success since 2018. Coughlan’s celebrity is still new to him, but it comes with a lot of curiosity.</strong></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>In the instance of Nicola, the most often asked questions have been ‘is Nicola Coughlan gay?’ and about her relationship. While her professional life appears to be well-known, her personal life remains a mystery to the majority of people.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>So keep reading to learn everything you need to know about Nicola’s spouse.</p><h2>Who Is Nicola Coughlan’s Boyfriend?</h2><p>When renowned people keep their relationship private, this is one of the most commonly requested questions. Nicola has kept the details of her boyfriend or partner private, and she rarely discusses her relationships in her interviews.</p><p>Another reason some believe she is a lesbian is her support for the LGBTQIA+ community. Nicola is honest and passionate about her community support. She campaigned door to door in Ireland in 2015, urging people to vote yes in an equal-marriage referendum.</p><p>Not only that, but Coughlan has an Instagram story highlighted with a pride symbol where she demonstrates her community support and is really enthusiastic about it.</p><p>Coughlan has tremendous love and respect for the people of the town, which is extremely heartwarming. Her character in the television series ‘Derry Girls’ is a lesbian, and she came out as a lesbian in the first season.</p><p>Many of these factors may lead to speculation that Nicola is a lesbian. It is not uncommon for tabloids to question a celebrity’s sexuality based on the roles they play or their online social media presence, but we cannot confirm anything until Nicola herself feels comfortable enough to discuss the topic.</p><p>As a result, her displaying support for the LGBT community and portraying a gay character does not always call into question her sexuality. She could be a huge supporter of the LGBTQIA+ community and is very passionate about advocating for their rights and well-being.</p><p>Concerning her romantic life, she was formerly thought to be in a relationship with a hairdresser named Jonathan Van Ness. However, the idea was quickly debunked because Jonathan, her reported partner, is gay and they are nothing but good friends.</p><p>They appear to spend a lot of time together and hang out together. So, even if Jonathan isn’t the one she’s dating, we’re sure he knows a lot about her personal life and who she’s dating.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: How Does Katie George, An ESPN Sporyscaster, Get Paid?"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/what-does-katie-george-an-espn-sportscaster-get-paid/"}{"1":65}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>How Does Katie George, An ESPN Sporyscaster, Get Paid?</a></span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Vanessa Lachey’s Mother Abandoned Her When She Was A Child</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Is Michaela Coel Dating Anyone?
