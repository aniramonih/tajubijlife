"Make some noise for my baby father!" she said, as her beau raised his arms and grinned.</p><p>Not surprisingly, fans flipped out. "OMG @NICKIMINAJ OMG #BESTCONCERTEVER guess who's pregnant," the fan who shared the video wrote via Twitter.</p><p>Minaj, for her part, seemed to enjoy — and even encourage — the pregnancy speculation. She retweeted multiple fan reactions to her "baby father" comment, replying with just a series of laugh-crying emojis.</p><p dir=ltr lang=und>???????????????????????????????? <a href=#>https://t.co/NcPrkb7Q3N</a></p><p>— NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) <a href=#>August 9, 2015</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=und>???????????????????????????????????????????????????? <a href=#>https://t.co/ZY6YsuVPOW</a></p><p>— NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) <a href=#>August 9, 2015</a></p><p>She also posted a video after her Chicago concert on Sunday, Aug. 9, in which she alludes to another significant moment with her rapper boyfriend.</p><p>"Chicago, I love you and I'll never forget you. You guys made me so happy, and I can't thank you enough. Don't tell anybody what I did to Meek onstage, okay?" she said with a wink.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>This is not the first time the "Bang Bang" hitmaker has been the subject of pregnancy speculation. Last month, Meek, 28, told Shade 45's DJ Superstar Jay that he'd like to have kids "sooner or later" with the star. "Nicki ain't pregnant. But yeah, I wish," he said at the time.</p><p>Minaj replied via Twitter, writing, "No matter wut he, or anyone else says, Onika Tanya Maraj won't b pushing anyone1 out her vajayjay, until she's married. Now check that."</p><p>Babies are almost definitely in her future, though. In November, she told Complex that she hopes to have kids before she's put out her fifth album. (Her third, Pinkprint, was released in December.) "I feel like I was put here to be a mother," she shared.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKWim5ueeq61zZqhZpuRobmmsIymnJ6jXaK2rbiMoZyrZZKWr7p5xZqroZ2iYrK3sdGypqedXZu5qrzPnptmp6WpenN8kG5oaXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
