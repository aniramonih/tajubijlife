The master bedroom is over 2,000 sq. ft. and features his and hers sides with endless open bay views."</strong></p><p>One of the more distinctive aspects of the property is the "sky bar" located, where else, on the roof. There you'll find a fire pit, jacuzzi, and fully equipped bar complete with a gas grill. Another is the infinity-edge, glass-walled swimming pool, which purportedly "provides the indescribable feeling of swimming in an aquarium," according to the property's official website.</p><p>You can take a look at the former Patrick Dovigi mansion in the video below, courtesy of Alexander Team:</p><p></p><p>Patrick Dovigi has had kind of an unusual career.
