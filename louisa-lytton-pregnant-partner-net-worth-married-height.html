The actress was visiting a wedding fair and was surrounded by flowers and candles dressed on her tables.</span></p><p><span>She wrote a long caption on the post, saying,</span></p><p><span><strong>“Last night we went to a Wedding show . . With a bump, not what we had planned but it made it even more special! I had nothing to wear, nothing fits so wore a dress back to front to cover bump and pinned it so I didn’t flash.&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><span>Ben ate sushi and drank I had rice and watched we saw our wedding band perform live, we just need to figure out the wedding now! But at least we have the music, priorities right? Date nights are back and it feels so good.”</span></strong></p><p><span>Louisa also posted a short video showing how she hides her pregnant belly while working on the set. She shared a video of herself dressed in a lightweight, flowy shirt with a yellow scarf worn over as she portrayed her character, which she captioned:<strong> “Forever hiding the bump at work like…”</strong>, as she cradled her baby bump.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Is Louisa Lytton Married To Partner Ben Bhanvra?</strong></span></h2><p><span>On the last of May 2021, Louisa told <a href=# rel=noopener>OK!</a>,<strong> “We’ve cancelled the wedding altogether now,”</strong> as she is set to exchange the vows with her fiancé Ben Bhanvra after the birth of their first child together.</span></p><p><span>Louisa and Ben have had to <a href=# rel=noopener>postpone their wedding twice</a> already amid coronavirus restrictions that made planning and hosting the big day a nightmare. So with their wedding on hold, the pair started trying for a baby instead.</span></p><p><span>She said on Loose Women: <strong>“We’ve cancelled the wedding. I said to Ben, ‘let’s start trying because it doesn’t look like the wedding is happening’. Then we fell pregnant and officially our wedding could go ahead but it’s too late now.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The couple got engaged in the Maldives in May 2019, after dating for a year, and had hoped to get married in 2020. They had originally postponed their big day, hoping to tie the knot when restrictions allowed, but now it seems they will first wait for their new family.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/uploads/louisa-ytton-with-partner-ben-bhanvra.jpg alt="louisa ytton with partner ben bhanvra" width=650 height=812 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span><strong>Louisa Lytton with her soon to be husband Ben Bhanvra (©:Instagram/Louisa Lytton)</strong></span></p><p><span>Speaking about the romantic proposal, the actress said to The Sun<strong>: “When I saw him on one knee I started crying like a baby. I was so excited but my brain went into overdrive and I started freaking out. I had no idea he was going to propose.”</strong></span></p><p><span>But Ben’s proposal almost didn’t go as planned because they were <a href=# rel=noopener>interrupted by a cleaner</a>. Nevertheless, he became so frustrated by the time he had planned to pop up the question to Louisa, and he<strong> “just grabbed the ring and got down on one knee,”</strong>&nbsp;as reported on OK! Magazine.</span></p><p><span>The two first met in 2017 through a mutual friend with Louisa telling Fabulous magazine: <strong>“We clicked from the off and I just knew.”</strong> Ben moved into Louisa’s flat just four months after meeting, and in January 2018, the pair revealed they had moved into a three-story home in north London.</span></p><p><span>Louisa is pregnant with her first child with her fiancé Ben Bhanvra and has been getting ready to welcome their baby in September.</span></p><p><span>The happy couple announced their exciting news on Mother’s Day this year in a sweet video they made together, posted on Louisa’s Instagram page. She captioned the sweet video as a loving message to her mother and said she would soon be a mum herself.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Net Worth And Career Of Louisa Lytton</strong></span></h2><p><span>Having a keen interest in acting since a young age, Louisa Lytton learned her acting skills from some of the best tutors at London’s iconic Sylvia Young Theatre School. This platform led to Louisa securing her first professional role as the innocent schoolgirl Ruby Allen in BBC1’s BAFTA award-winning EastEnders&nbsp;when she was just 16 years old.</span></p><p><span>Since leaving EastEnders, Louisa continued to rise as she played in another iconic British television show, The Bill. Following this, Louisa has enjoyed a number of small and big roles, from parts in the internationally successful American Pie franchise to the British Shakespeare Company’s productions of both A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Much Ado About Nothing.</span></p><p><span>Apart from her acting career, she is also an accomplished dancer, competing in the fourth series of Strictly Come Dancing, where she successfully reached the quarter-finals. From this, Louisa toured the country as part of the sold-out Strictly Come Dancing arena tour and represented the UK in the 2008 Eurovision Dance Contest.</span></p><p><span>After a twelve-year hiatus, Louisa returned, reprising her role as Ruby Allen in September of 2018. The storyline she is focused on for her reprised the role in EastEnders was praised by viewers and critics alike.</span></p><p><span>She also talked once to The Sun&nbsp;about the reality of life as an actress and how she’d taken nannying and receptionist stopgap jobs during leaner work spells. However, those quotes were picked up by other publications as if it were something to be embarrassed about, and Louisa remains baffled as to why it all blew up.</span></p><p><span><strong>“Being an actress isn’t always a full-time career,”</strong> she said. Furthermore, she added,<strong> “I’m always happy to talk about that because it’s the truth. I’m not going to paint a pretty picture of it when there are kids out there going to drama school who need to know that you have to graft and you have to have other jobs.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The biggest earning cast has their salaries ranging from 150k pounds to 400k pounds. As Louisa, who plays an equally important cast, Ruby Allen, in the series, she is likely to have a salary around the range or even more in 2021. This helps her to gain the net worth which she has gain to date.</span></p><p><span>Some of the other TV shows and movies she has appeared in include Fractured, Young High and Dead, Edge of Heaven, The Door, and such. With her performances on the TV show EastEnders, she won a British Soap Award for Sexiest Female in 2006 and another award in the British Horror Film Festival for Best Supporting Actress from her role in the 2016 movie Caught.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46lpq6ho5Z6rcXTraanZaCnsqi6wKerZqiRp8GvsdFmpZ6sXay8s8DHZqSaqqKesqV5x56goKCk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
