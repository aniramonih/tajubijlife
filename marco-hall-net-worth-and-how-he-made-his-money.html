The American boxer, TikToker, and YouTuber has certainly come a long way from his humble beginnings in Ohio. A look at Hall‚Äôs Instagram page will show him and his wife dressed in stylish designer outfits of the highest quality. The couple also owns multiple luxurious cars.<br>Additionally, in early 2022, Marco Hall and his wife unveiled their Las Vegas mansion. The exquisite abode features multiple rooms and bathrooms, walk-in closets, a master suite, a garage, top-of-the-line appliances for the kitchen as well as a swimming pool.</p><h2><strong>Sources of Marco Hall‚Äôs Net Worth</strong></h2><h3><strong>Marco Hall‚Äôs Family-Themed YouTube Channel has Close to 6 Million Subscribers and Over 6 Billion Views</strong></h3><p>Marco Hall owes his wealth to his career as a digital content creator, and one of the platforms where he is most popular is YouTube. Hall first created his YouTube account in 2012 and used it to share videos of his boxing sessions. He later met his wife, Brooke Ashley, and they decided to create a YouTube channel that focuses on their family adventures.</p><p>The Beverly Halls YouTube channel came into existence in 2014 but really took off around 2019. Hall shares comedic videos, pranks, and vlogs involving his wife and the three sons that they have between them. The videos are often hilarious and candid and fetch lots of views. The Beverly Halls YouTube channel has about 6 million subscribers and 6 billion views. On average, Marco Hall gets 1.9 million views per video.</p><p>It is hard to tell the exact money that YouTube pays creators but it <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ranges</a> from $1.61 to $29.30 per 1000 views. If we take both figures, it means that Marco Hall may have made about $9.6 million from YouTube and as high as $175 million. Of course, it will be higher than this in reality, but there is no doubt that Marco Hall‚Äôs YouTube earnings would have breached the $1 million mark.</p><h3><strong>His TikTok Channel is Equally Lucrative with 10 Million Followers and Billions of Views</strong></h3><p>Another social media platform that Marco Hall is making a lot of money from is TikTok. He and his wife decided to join the platform in 2020, as a result of the pandemic, and the results have been awesome. Their unique brand of short videos focusing on family adventures, prank videos, and comedy has also been a hit with people on the platform. Marco Hall has over 10 million followers on TikTok, and his videos attract about 200 million views in a month. This means that he will make an impressive income on the platform.</p><p>One of the <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ways</a> of making money through TikTok is the TikTok creators‚Äô fund. The fund makes it possible for creators to earn from two to four cents per 1000 views. If Marco Hall gets 200 million views each month, it means that he can possibly make $4,000 to $8,000 directly from TikTok each month. He can also earn additional money on TikTok from other means such as tips from fans and promoting new songs.</p><a title=@iammarcohall href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@iammarcohall</a><p>With her sickness of Hyperemesis Gravidarum it‚Äôs gonna be a challenge!üôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è @brookeashleyhall</p><p><a title="‚ô¨ Players - DJ Smallz 732 - Jersey Club Remix - Coi Leray" href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">‚ô¨ Players ‚Äì DJ Smallz 732 ‚Äì Jersey Club Remix ‚Äì Coi Leray</a></p><h3><strong>Marco Hall also has a Stake in the Social Media App ‚Äì Triller</strong></h3><p>Beyond YouTube and TikTok, Marco Hall is also active on the social media platform known as Triller. Triller is a video creation app that launched in 2020. It lets users create and edit short videos and post them within the app and on other social media platforms. Marco Hall signed a one-year contract with Triller in November 2021.</p><p>The<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> contract</a> requires him to post eight videos to Triller per month and also post eight videos, with references to Triller, on any other social platform. The videos have to be at least 30 seconds long unless it is a dance video which can be 15 seconds. In exchange, Marco Hall will receive a $2000 payment each month. He will also receive $2000 worth of shares in Triller each month.</p><h3><strong>He Launched His Official Merch Store in the Summer of 2021</strong></h3><p>Another way for social media influencers to make money is by creating an official merch store where fans can go and buy branded items. Marco Hall and his wife launched their official merch store in the summer of 2021. The store carries branded items such as T-shirts which retail for about $29 per piece. The exact income that Marco Hall has earned from his merch store is not available but it would be up to thousands of dollars if not tens of thousands of dollars.</p><h3><strong>Marco Hall has also Landed Advertising Gigs with the Likes of Quash Life Lift</strong></h3><p>Many brands often seek out social media influencers to help advertise them to wilder audiences. Of course, such gigs don‚Äôt come for free as they have to pay handsomely for them. One of those that have benefitted from these juicy advertising gigs is Marco Hall. Marco Hall has done sponsored posts and ads for companies such as <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Quash Life Lift</a>, an energy drink produced by Bang Energy. Hall and his family also featured in a commercial for a company back in August 2022.

He won four of those bouts while one ended in a defeat for him. It is believed that boxers early in their careers <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">make</a> about $1,000 to $4,000 per fight, or from $5,000 to $10,000. Marco Hall would have earned something in this region as well.</p><p>Hall is currently on a hiatus from boxing and has been so since 2018. He however plans to go back and engage in celebrity boxing matches. He will certainly make a lot of money from it.
