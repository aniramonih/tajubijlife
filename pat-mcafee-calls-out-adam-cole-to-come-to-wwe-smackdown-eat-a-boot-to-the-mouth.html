The two had some solid matches against one another and after a hiatus from WWE television, Pat McAfee made his way to Friday Night Smackdown as part of the commentary team.</p><p>While speaking on <a href=#>WWE’s The Bump</a>, Adam Cole took a shot at Pat McAfee and really went after him as he stated that McAfee is an embarrassment, when asked about McAfee’s alliance with Pete Dunne.</p><p>“Pat McAfee, again, the fact that he has tricked so many people into working alongside him kind of blows my mind that was a really, really big issue for me, but again, my hatred for Pat was so strong that again, it could have been anybody and I was laser-focused on Pat the whole time.</p><p>I wouldn’t want to talk about that embarrassment Pat McAfee either, I don’t blame him,”</p><p>While speaking on his podcast <a href=#>The Pat McAfee Show, </a>Pat McAfee responded to Adam Cole’s remarks about him. McAfee didn’t mince any words as he called out Cole to come to Friday Night Smackdown and eat a boot to his mouth.</p><p>“This morning he called me an embarrassment or something like that and went on this entire run. Hey Adam Cole, pal, listen. You are talking to mister Friday night now. Run your mouth on my internet? Come over Friday pal, say what you gotta say, and eat another boot to the f**king mouth.”</p><p>Adam Cole will be competing against Kyle O’Reilly, Johnny Gargano and Karrion Kross in a fatal five-way match at NXT TakeOver: In Your House for the NXT Championship this Sunday. We wonder if Cole will eventually be called up to Friday Night Smackdown and continue his feud with Pat McAfee.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX9ye49vZmpoX6WutXnMnJifnZVisKK4y6xkqK2kYq6lrcxmmqiklWLBsHnCqKSeZaSkerjDxGaqppmToLGww81mnJqsXZZ6o7vOrWStp12ptaZ5zKisraBf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
