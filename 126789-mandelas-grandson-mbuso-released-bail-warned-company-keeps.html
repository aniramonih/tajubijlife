Teffo is defending four out of five men who are being accused of killing the famed <a href=#>soccer</a> player.</p><p class=align-left>In a statement issued by the Office of the Chief Justice, Zondo <a href=#>condemned the police's conduct</a> and found the way they carried out the arrest warrant unacceptable. Zondo stated that upon reviewing the footage, Zondo said the fact that Teffo was arrested inside the same <a href=#>court</a> he had been carrying out his work was inappropriate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfLGxzqmjnmdhZ4N4hJhmpJqmlJq5or%2BMoKmappSovK95zJusrKddp7KtscCsnJ1lkpa2rXnWmqmnnZRisLC5z5qlsmWbmrKxv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
