Her height paid off as a big advantage when she decided to build a career as a model. For those who are yet to know this, Diaz delved into the world of modeling as a teenager; she was only 16 years old.</p><p>While she was practically still a kid, she was able to gain the attention of big shots in the industry and this saw her land modeling gigs with prominent establishments across the world. She worked with companies like Levi’s and Calvin Klein and when she turned 17, she made the front cover of Seventeen; that was in July 1990.</p><p>Without a doubt, it would have been difficult or impossible for her to quickly find her footing in the industry if she wasn’t good-looking with a good height.

While she is almost 5 feet 9 inches, he is barely taller than the average American male at 5 feet 7 inches.</p><p>Apart from her husband, Diaz is taller than other celebrities like Nicole Richie, Hailey Baldwin, Emily Ratajkowski, Cara Delevingne, Amber Rose, and many others. Meanwhile, she shares the same height as Jennifer Lawrence, Julia Roberts, and Catherine Duchess.</p><h2><strong>How Cameron Diaz Maintains Her Weight</strong></h2><p>The former model has been able to maintain a fine and trim body over the years, even after childbirth. Thanks to this, she is still counted among the sexiest female celebrities despite the fact that she is approaching 50. She weighs anything from 58 to 65 kg and has been able to maintain this because of her diet and workout routines. Teddy Bass her fitness trainer once asserted that Cameron is very athletic.</p><p>In addition to observing a consistent workout schedule, Diaz observes a No-white diet which forbids her from consuming white carbs and sugar. Her meals largely consist of fruits, protein, and healthy carbs. She once disclosed that she loves French fries and fried chicken but they are the things she gave up for the sake of her health.</p><h2><strong>Details of Her Other Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>For someone who inspires a good number of those who aspire to have a modeling career, it is hardly a surprise that many have come to regard Diaz’s body measurements as the ideal physique for the industry. While this is not necessarily true, it is evident that anyone with her kind of body would thrive as a model and in show biz.</p><p>Cameron Diaz is paying what’s due to aging and things are not the way it used to be for her.
