And the numbers are somewhat staggering.</p><p>Abry is investing $100 million to acquire a 15% stake in HartBeat. Paying $100 million for a 15% stake, mean's Kevin's company is now valued at…</p><h2><strong>$650 million</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-332122 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/kevin.jpg alt="Kevin Hart Billionaire" width=900 height=655 sizes="(max-width: 1649px) 100vw, 1649px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-332122 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Chris Polk/PMA2014/Getty Images for dcp)</p><p>A significant portion of the $100 million cash infusion will go to Kevin personally, with another chunk going to HartBeat for planned investments and content productions. More importantly for Kevin, his remaining 85% ownership stake in HartBeat is now officially worth…</p><h2><strong>$552 million</strong></h2><p>Even before this mega-deal, Kevin was one of the highest-paid entertainers in the world. In a typical year, Kevin earns $40-60 million. The majority of those earnings typically come from touring thanks to Kevin's routinely-sold-out stadium tours.</p><p>This new venture will allow Kevin to earn significantly more money through content licensing deals such as an upcoming Roku series called "Die Hart" and a Netflix series called "Me Time." According to the Wall Street Journal, Kevin currently has dozens of projects in the works for a variety of streaming services.</p><p>Prior to this deal we estimated Kevin Hart's net worth to be $200 million. Conservatively assuming Kevin personally received around half of the $100 million cash infusion, that will likely result in a $25 million after-tax windfall for the comedian. It would not be inaccurate to say that the full $552 million enterprise value of Kevin's 85% stake should be added to his former net worth. If you did that, it would not be inaccurate to say that Kevin's new net worth would be north of $750 million. To be extremely conservative, and to take into account a future tax bill when a liquidity event eventually occurs, we now estimate <a href=#>Kevin Hart's net worth to be $450 million</a>.</p><p>That's no joke.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnC3xK%2Bgp2WYlr%2B1ecmuqq1lo6S5pXmQbmSonl2dtrR5zJ6bopldmLyuvMCnsGaZpGKuboKUaWSmoZyhtrC6jK%2BYpa2Rqbawuo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
