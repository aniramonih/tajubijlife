So, like I always want him to be happy and he always wants me to be happy, which in turn, makes a very happy house."&nbsp;</p><p id=elALcT_QC7Vs data-wc=20>Spencer agreed, saying: "The way she is with Theodore makes me love her more and more on a daily basis."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b5af0b9af214-spencer-vogue-z.jpg><p id=eSReCFkijMGT data-wc=57>Spencer also reveals lots of gossip about when they first started dating, with Spencer joking: "I joked at the very beginning that I was going to marry you, but it was just a joke ... I thought that when we first met, that you and I would have a lifelong friendship, a kind of Muskateer type bond."&nbsp;</p><p id=enPZG0NI7Cvb data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>See stunning photos from Spencer Matthews and Vogue Williams' intimate wedding</a></strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=eTz_twOtYe_7 data-wc=10><strong>VIDEO: Vogue and Spencer talk romance for New Look's IGTV&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eh63NWjbtdC_ data-wc=76>Vogue also reveals that she was "desperate" to keep their budding relationship a secret when they first started dating in 2017 when they both starred on . Spencer, on the other hand, told everyone. "I told my mother, I told everyone. I literally said 'I'm going out with Vogue Williams,' and she was pretending to othercontestants that we weren't even hooking up." Spencer even told her he loved her on their first date.&nbsp;</p><p id=ePSCuyjvY0zf data-wc=67>When asked who the best chef is in the household, they were both in agreement that Spencer is "one hundred per cent" the best cook, and a date night involves roast lamb and a massive bowl of brussels&nbsp;sprouts. Ooh, is that on the menu for Valentine's Day night? Or maybe they'll be heading out to a lavish restaurant, but we&nbsp;hope Spencer remembers his credit card.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
