The beauty guru founder has been open about having lip filler, and she practically invented concept of lip kits when she launched her eponymous makeup brand in 2015. Now, the mogul is resurrecting a lip trend that was popular in the '90s, when she was probably a little too young to be repping the fad: dark-lined lips.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kylie Jenner/Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Monday, Jenner shared a series of selfies to her Instagram, in which she modeled an unexpected color combo on her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lips</a>, as well as white Skims booty shorts, a matching crop top, and a leather moto-jacket. Her hair parted down the middle and pulled into a messy bun, save for one wavy strand that framed her face.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"new favorite lip combo ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•&nbsp;@kyliecosmetics," she captioned the carousel.

Kylie Cosmetics also shared a video to their socials that showed the businesswoman perfecting the look.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jenner has been candid about feeling self conscious of her lips in the past. During the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>reunion of her family's former E! show</a> Keeping Up With the Kardashians, she told host Andy Cohen that it actually led her to launching her billion-dollar brand. &nbsp;"I think my love for makeup started with my insecurity with my lips. I had really small lips, and I didn't ever think about it until I had one of my first kisses and a guy said to me, 'Oh my God, you're such a good kisser, but you have such small lips,' or something like that. From then on, I felt unkissable."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, "I had an insecurity because this guy said something to me one time.
