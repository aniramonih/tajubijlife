And when one’s ego is endangered, one will almost always strike out.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><span><span>In a similar vein, you could wonder what the precept “when given the option between being correct</span></span> <span><span>and being nice, choose kindness” really means.</span></span></h3><p>When given the option between doing what is right and doing what is nice, choose kindness. It suggests to me that you should be courteous rather than harshly correcting someone’s behaviour. For example, I may be accurate, but I do not make a big deal about it since I am aware that someone else may not have been correct as well as I am.</p><p></p><h3>Furthermore, which is more important: doing what is right or being compassionate?</h3><p>In this case, the remark from Scott Fitzgerald comes into play: “Being nice and listening to others are frequently more essential than continually attempting to be right and prove others wrong.”</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3><span><span>Second, when faced with the decision between being correct and being nice, choose kindness as an</span></span> <span><span>example instead.</span></span></h3><p>“When given the option between being correct and being nice, CHOOSE KIND.” This is the principle to live by. This principle requires that you be considerate of others. Consider the following scenario: you do well on a test. You can see your pal over there, and he didn’t do that well, too.</p><p></p><h3>When do you take the opportunity to be correct or to be kind?</h3><p>“If you have a choice between doing what is right and doing what is nice, choose kindness” (Dr. Wayne W. Dyer) It happens every now and then that you come across a book that sticks out, that makes you feel better, or that causes you to think more deeply.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>There were 30 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><h3><span><span>In what way does the September precept, “When given the option between doing what is right and</span></span> <span><span>doing what is kind, choose kindness,” apply?</span></span></h3><p>The terms in this collection (16) The precept for September is When presented with the option of being correct or being nice, choose kindness. This phrase reminds me that you don’t always have to be correct in your decisions in life. All that is required is that you be nice and courteous to yourself and to others.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Who stated that it is preferable to be nice than to be correct in every situation?</h3><p>Anne Lamott said the following: “It is preferable to be nice than to be correct.”</p><p></p><h3>What does Auggie use to compare his eating habits to?</h3><p>August despises the way he eats because of the way he seems to be eating when he does.

Palacio’s narrative WONDER, seeks to disseminate the idea of good social change by encouraging individuals to engage in acts of kindness on a daily basis. Student participation in the Challenge will encourage them to consistently offer compassion, acceptance, and respect to their classmates.</p><p></p><h3>What are the benefits of being kind?</h3><p>It is crucial to be nice because it helps you feel better about your own abilities. When you do things for other people, whether it’s helping them with math or schoolwork or anything else, it simply makes you feel good about yourself because you know you’ve helped someone. Just like respect, kindness is a two-way street that requires both giving and receiving. If you want to be respected, you must first demonstrate respect to others.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What type of wonderment does Auggie have?</h3><p>Auggie Pullman, the primary character of Wonder, is a little boy named August. The combination of Treacher Collins syndrome and hemifacial microsomia caused his facial abnormality at birth, which prohibited him from attending a traditional school until the fifth grade, when he was accepted into Beecher Preparatory School.</p><p></p><h3>What exactly is a precept in the book, I’m curious?</h3><p>A monthly precept is presented by Auggie’s instructor Mr. Browne, who defines it as “something that helps guide us when making judgments about truly important things” in the book Wonder.

Instead of leaving a statue, you should leave a deed. Doing a good act creates a lasting impression on someone, and every time you do one, you leave your stamp on the world.</p><p></p><h3>When you are given the option of being right or being wrong, what do you choose?</h3><p>“When given the option between doing what is right and doing what is nice, choose kindness.” “Dr. Wayne W.
