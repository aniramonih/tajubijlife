However, she has two children with her first husband, Rory Fleming. After their divorce, she was engaged to Nicklas Bendtner but they also split up after giving birth to one child.</strong></p><p><strong>Baroness Caroline Elizabeth Ada Iuel-Brockdorff</strong>, known professionally as <strong>Caroline Fleming</strong>, is a Danish aristocratic entrepreneur, <strong><a href=#>model</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=#>television personality</a></strong> who also has written three cookbooks: Cook Yourself Happy: The Danish Way; two Danish ones: Baronessen går i køkkenet (The Baroness in the Kitchen) and Baronessens sunde fastfood (The Baroness's Healthy Fastfood).</p><p>Likely, the star has also appeared in Kanal 4 productions such as Baronessen flytter ind (The Baroness Moves In) and Danmarks Naeste Topmodel. Furthermore, she starred in the reality show Ladies of London from 2015 to 2017.</p><p>Recently, Caroline Fleming's love affair has been a personal interest among many of her fans. Asa result, many people have curious to know if she has a boyfriend currently. Well, here's what we have discovered.</p><p>Previously, we discussed the&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>relationship status</strong></a> of <a href=#><strong>Maya Jama</strong></a>&nbsp;and <a href=#><strong>Ari Fletcher</strong></a>.</p><h2>2023: Caroline Fleming Does Not Appear to Have a New Boyfriend!</h2><p>As of writing, <strong>Caroline Fleming</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@carolineflemingofficial</a>) doesn't seem to have a new boyfriend because she has never revealed anything about being in a relationship with anyone until date (2023).</p><p>However, the Ladies of London star has been married before to her first husband, <strong>Rory Fleming </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@flemingrory</a>), the nephew of James Bond creator <strong>Ian Fleming</strong>.

Caroline Fleming and her ex-husband are well aware of this. Their relationship was put to the test, just like any other relationship is. However, the pair, who became reality stars in Denmark, were unable to maintain their marriage and chose to split.</p><p>And you might be surprised to learn the reason for the divorce because, according to the sources, Rory believes she is entitled to the money. He didn't want to be in court for a long time. What's more, it's not as if he did something wrong and is doing penance - Caroline merely stated that she was bored and wanted a change.</p><p>Because of the couple's ties to Danish royalty and the James Bond brand, their divorce was well-publicized, and a large sum of money was at stake. Later, Rory, whose family is thought to be rich <strong>£1.05 billion</strong>, handed up more than <strong>£400 million</strong> to Caroline without hesitation. She had to keep her surname Fleming since she had to give up her baroness title when she married a non-royal.</p><p>But following her divorce, socialite Caroline had become quite well-known, and she made headlines when she was rumored to be dating<strong> Nicklas Bendtner</strong>, a striker for Arsenal at the time. She met her then-boyfriend while appearing on a Danish reality show, Valdemar's home as a guest, and they also collaborated on a pictorial to advertise his attendance. Long before the couple began dating, she expressed her feelings toward Bendtner during their first meeting, <a href=# rel=noopener>saying</a>,</p><p><strong>He is charming and bright and he's very willing to help other people.You never know when our paths will cross again.</strong></p><p>Only two years later, the couple began dating. In 2010, the couple announced their engagement and pregnancy. When everyone was ready for the couple to go down the aisle, they parted only seven weeks after their baby was born, and according to <a href=# rel=noopener>reports</a>,</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p><strong>It was a whirlwind relationship, and they were madly in love - perhaps they realised in the end that they were poles apart in age and viewpoint.The birth of a kid can strain any relationship, but there appears to be greater tension on them both recently in the previous few weeks.</strong></p><p>However, for the sake of their child, the ex-couple chose to maintain contact and stay close. Furthermore,&nbsp;&nbsp;Caroline has always found herself in the public eye for one reason or another. However, she has not recently stated anything about having a boyfriend and does not appear to be involved with anyone.</p><h2>Caroline Fleming's Net Worth!</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/08/caroline-fleming-networth-2023.jpg alt="Caroline Fleming's net worth is estimated to be $350 million. celebsindepth.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Caroline Fleming's net worth is estimated to be $350 million.&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Instagram</strong></p><p><strong>Caroline Fleming</strong> was previously married to <strong>Rory Fleming</strong>, whom she <a href=# rel=noopener>divorced</a> in 2008.
