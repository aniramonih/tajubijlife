I had a chance to catch up with the reality star and ask her all about how <a href=# class=T3D>she maintains her blonde hair</a> and the one product she can't live without.</p><p>After witnessing the state of her hair on the Bahamas episode <i>RKOBH</i>, Stewart tells me she was appalled and immediately looked for a solution. She found it in <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>celebrity colorist Justin Anderson</a>, who was once described as "the rising star of blonde Hollywood" by <i>Vogue</i> and is the creative director of <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>dpHUE</a>. Anderson regularly highlights Stewart's hair, but since he can't be by her side 24/7, Stewart has learned a few tricks to keep her blonde hair sparkling.</p><p>The one product she swears by? Stewart tells me she lives by <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>dpHUE's Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse</a>, which allows her to skip regular shampooing to keep her hair healthy.</p><p>"I don’t like to over-wash my hair, especially with how fine it is — shampooing every day strips out all of the natural oils, drying out my hair. But I can’t skip washing my hair because I do yoga three days a week," Stewart explains. "I’ve been using the Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse by dpHUE a few times a week as a substitute for shampoo and conditioner, and it has been life-changing."</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><i>dpHUE's Apple Cider Vinegar Hair Rinse, $35, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>sephora.com</a></i></p><p>Stewart also swears by <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>dpHUE's Cool Blonde Shampoo</a> and <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Cool Blonde Conditioner</a> (which she uses about once a week) to keep her hair from looking brassy — a common problem for blondes.</p><p>"Some [purple shampoos] I've tried are too intense and all of the sudden you realize that your hair is grey. But dpHUE’s version is a must have," says Stewart. "I feel like Justin preaches this to me, and for my hair, a violet tone is much better than a blue tone."</p><p>Her other tricks for keeping hair healthy? Using a hair oil to extend the life of a blowout (Stewart's favorite is <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>dpHUE's Argan Oil Therapy</a> because it doesn't leave a brown tint on her hair) and sleeping on silk pillowcases.</p><p>"Not only is sleeping on a silk pillowcase sexy, but it's good for your hair!" Stewart says.</p><p>Sounds good to me.</p><p><i>Images: </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Justin Anderson</i></a><i>/Instagram, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Morgan Stewart</i></a><i>/Instagram</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyg5hrcGxloqC8o7TSZqSoqpeWu26%2F056umqqkYsC4scCrqmaaqWKusbzLnmScoZSav27CyKecoJmiYsGwecqenKllmJq%2Fbq7LqKWdnV2hvKS30maeqKSUmrs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
