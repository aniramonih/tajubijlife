The mother-of-three has been unveiled as the host of BBC's new cookery show . The news has caused a stir on social media, as the show has been tipped to rival itself, which has moved to Channel 4. The baking guru won't be hosting solo: she will be joined by 's <a class=hm-link href=#>Zoe Ball</a>, while <a class=hm-link href=#>celebrity chefs Rosemary Shrager and Giorgio Locatelli</a> will be acting as judges in the competition.</p><p id=e21Uo5XE_juN data-wc=61>Nadiya took to Twitter to celebrate as the news was revealed on Friday, posting a short and sweet message to convey her enthusiasm. "So exciting!" she wrote. Congraulatory messages began pouring in from fans, many clamouring for more details of when they would see the star on the screen. "It will be in the autumn," she replied to one user's tweet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9a65ed9ef46c-nadiya-hussain-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e3qWtpW8g-Kq data-wc=13><strong>Nadiya Hussain has been announced as the host of BBC's new cooking show</strong></p><p id=eKfELLWV1695 data-wc=51>will see sixteen families inviting Nadiya, Zoe, Rosemary and Giorgio to their homes, where they will cook their favourite recipes and face a series of foodie challenges in a bid to impress the panel.

Social media went into meltdown last year when it was revealed that was moving to Channel 4, and viewers have been avidly waiting to see if the BBC would offer a replacement. While <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Mary Berry</a>, <a class=hm-link href=#>Sue Perkins</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Mel Giedroyc</a></strong> all revealed they would remain with the BBC, judge <a class=hm-link href=#>Paul Hollywood</a> made the controversial decision to remain as a judge and move to the new channel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e5183b782553-nadiya-mary-berry-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eMNxryg8E5xb data-wc=8><strong>Nadiya won in 2015</strong></p><p id=eh8rNj2DK7w0 data-wc=89>However, the 51-year-old has since opened up about his choice, and explained he was looking forward to the "second chapter". "Chapter one is finished but the second chapter is about to begin," <a class=hm-link href=#>he said during the Good Food Show.</a> "I can't really say too much but none of us were involved in the negotiations. You have the production company and then you have the channel. I always work for the production companyâ€¦ For the new series we will have the same tent, the same crew and the same challenges.
