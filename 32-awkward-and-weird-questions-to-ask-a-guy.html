Would you rather have 10 wives or 10 children?</b></h3><p>A harem of wives or a brood of children, which one tickles his fancy more? &nbsp;As weird as this question is, his answer will give you an insight into the kind of guy he is. You will get a more sincere answer if the guy is simply your friend or your brother, as he may be reluctant to say his actual answer if you are romantically connected.</p><h3><b>9.

Asking a guy how many times he thinks about sex in a day is top on the list of awkward questions to ask a guy.

How healthy do you consider masturbation to be?</b></h3><p>This is a tricky awkward question because you are not asking him to admit to masturbation but his answer may be considered an admission, because if he says masturbation is very healthy, it may imply that he is also an active masturbator. Not everyone wants to admit that they practice self-sex.</p><h3><b>15. What is the stupidest thing you have ever said to someone?</b></h3><p>Have him think of all the stupid things he may have said to people and pick out the most stupid of them all.

What insect are you most afraid of?</b></h3><p>A guy wouldn’t want to admit he is afraid of any insect at all. Being afraid of insects is considered a feminine trait, however, many guys are actually afraid of certain insects. Find out which insect he is afraid of with this awkward question.</p><h3><b>18. Have you ever walked in on a couple having sex?</b></h3><p>Walking into a couple having sex is a very awkward situation and asking him if he has ever walked into a couple having sex, would mean you asking him to remember a very awkward situation if he has ever been in such a situation. This is an awkward question about an awkward situation, which means double awkwardness.</p><h3><b>19. How many lies do you tell in a day?</b></h3><p>Not many people admit that they tell lies, so one of the most awkward questions you can ask a guy is how many lies he tells in a day. Because he wouldn’t want to paint himself as a liar to you, he will most likely lie about his answer.</p><h3><b>20. Guess how many guys I have kissed</b></h3><p>The question is about you, but it will surely make him feel very awkward because he will not want to hurt your feelings by naming an outrageous number, he may also be afraid to guess the correct number, especially if you are his love interest.

Are you in love with me?</b></h3><p>If you are suspecting that a guy has a crush on you, this is one of the most awkward questions you can ask him, because you are putting him in the “now or never” spot.

Do you pee on yourself when you shower?</b></h3><p>Most people pee on themselves when they are taking a shower, however, it is still embarrassing, especially for a guy to be asked such a question or to admit that he pees on himself when taking a shower.</p><h3><b>30. Will you marry me?</b></h3><p>This is one of the topmost embarrassing questions to ask a guy.

What is the most embarrassing thing you have ever done?</b></h3><p>Having a guy recount the most embarrassing thing he has ever done is in itself embarrassing. He will become embarrassed all over again.</p><h3><b>32. Have you ever lusted after a friend’s girlfriend?</b></h3><p>Most guys may never admit that they have lusted after their friend’s girlfriend and it will be very embarrassing to ask them such a question, so if your plan is to make him feel very embarrassed, this question works.</p><h2><b>Awkward And Weird Questions To Never Ask A Guy</b></h2><p>Although awkward, weird, and embarrassing questions are usually outlandish, there are some questions you should never ask a guy, especially if he is not your lover or husband.</p><p><b>Financial status:</b> Do not ask about his income or debt profile. Do not ask him how much he makes or the highest he has ever earned. This question is reserved for couples.</p><p><b>His sexual prowess:</b> This is especially for a guy you are in a platonic relationship with. It gives off the wrong signal and he may assume you are asking him as a form of invitation.</p><p><b>Health condition: </b>If he has a visible or a known health condition, do not ask any weird or awkward questions about it.</p><p><b>If he is comfortable with the size of his private part: </b>This is a no-go area as it may trigger insecurities.

Traumatic experiences should be avoided.</p><p><b>Body size:</b> Avoid questions like “why are you so fat or why are you so skinny”. It is akin to body shaming.</p><p><b>Body Count:</b> Except he offers to tell you himself, you shouldn’t ask him how many women he has slept with. He may not be honest with you, so there’s no need to ask. Plus, except you are his health professional, it is not your business to know.</p><p><b>If he is a mummy’s boy: </b>There is absolutely no need for this question. Even mummy’s boys do not admit to it and he may find the question upsetting.</p><p><b>…In conclusion</b>, awkward and weird questions to ask a guy are meant to create interesting, expository, and fun conversations.
