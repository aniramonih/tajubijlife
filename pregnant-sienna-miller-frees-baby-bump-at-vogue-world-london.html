She teamed the top with a billowing balloon skirt, which made her look like a blossoming bouquet.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Miller contrasted the outfit with black sheer tights and dark-colored pumps.

In photos obtained by People, Miller was seen showing off her baby bump while wearing a bikini in Ibiza.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The actress initially sparked pregnancy speculation in July while she vacationed with Green and her daughter, Marlowe, in St. Tropez. (Miller shares her 10-year-old with ex <a href=#><strong>Tom Sturridge</strong></a>.) During the getaway, Miller sported a noticeable baby bump as she swam in the ocean wearing a rainbow bikini.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Miller and Green were <a href=#>first linked</a> in February 2022 after being spotted on a date in New York. The twosome continued to make the rounds that spring, attending a BAFTAs afterparty together in London in March 2022 and posing on the Vanity Fair Oscar Party red carpet in Beverly Hills later that month.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>As Miller’s romance with Green blossomed, she opened up to <a href=#>Elle UK</a> about whether she wanted more kids. In the April 2022 interview, Miller revealed that she chose to freeze her eggs when she turned 40 after feeling “pressure” to expand her family.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sienna-Miller-Frees-the-Bump-at-Vogue-World-3.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Biology is incredibly cruel on women in that decade [of their 30s] — that’s the headline, or it certainly was for me. Then I got to 40 and I froze some eggs,” Miller said. “Having been really focused on the need to have another baby, I’m just like, if it happens, it happens. That kind of existential threat has dissipated.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Prior to dating Green, Miller has been engaged several times. She split from fiancé <a href=#><strong>Jude Law</strong></a> in 2006 after he admitted to <a href=#>having an affair</a> with his children’s nanny. Miller and Law, 50, rekindled their romance three years later but called it quits for good in 2011.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She moved on with Sturridge, 37, whom she dated from 2011 to 2015. Although they parted ways, the exes have remained friends and vigilant coparents to Marlowe, who they welcomed in 2012. “I love being a mother. It’s what I do best,” Miller gushed to<a href=#> British Vogue</a> in November 2022.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Miller was later engaged to <a href=#><strong>Lucas Zwirner</strong></a>, but the pair split in September 2020.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6W%2FprPNmqWtZaOesq%2B6wGakoqScmr9ustGenKxlkpavunnBrqSpZZGpere7xq6cZq%2Bfp7mlecuopZ2nnmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
