However, recent remarks have turned her into a meme on social media.</p><p><strong>Higareda </strong>went viral after the interview she gave to <strong>Yordi Rosado</strong>, to whom she stressed that she had turned down an offer to act in a movie with <strong>Robert Pattinson</strong> in the United States in order to stay in Mexico to star in the film 'No Manches Frida'.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Higareda's incredible 'adventures'</h2><p>These comments did nothing but cause people's mockery. The aforementioned Mexican production had a good response at the box office in 2016, but both <strong>Martha </strong>and her co-star, <strong>Omar Chaparro</strong>, made other movies together before the audience got fed up with them.</p><p>Then, many people on social media did not believe her claims and called it a lie, since they could not imagine how someone had rejected a role alongside the star of 'The Batman' and the 'Twilight' saga for one alongside the controversial former Telehit host.</p><p>Then fans remembered that <strong>Higareda </strong>had also shared dubious stories in the past. For instance, the actress said she met <strong>Canelo Alvarez</strong> on a plane and said she didn't know who he was, that she thought he was a 'narco'. Then they talked and she predicted he would win a fight.</p><p>Other stories include when she claimed she could speak at four years old, or how her family have seen aliens.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>The NFL 'makes fun' of Martha Higareda</h2><p>Now, it was the turn of the NFL Mexico's Twitter account to create a meme about <strong>Higareda</strong>.</p><p>"I promise, <strong>Yordi</strong>," the meme reads.</p><p>"I taught <strong><a href=#>Patrick Mahomes</a></strong> how to throw on a farm in Texas."</p><p>This comes as the NFL Mexico account was promoting the schedule release for the new season, in which the <strong><a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a></strong> quarterback will play on opening night against the <strong>Detroit Lions</strong>.</p><p>There won't be any NFL game in Mexico this season, however, due to renovations at the Estadio Azteca.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqedpWeblru0rdJmmqKsqWKwqbXEn6poamBngHB8lGhoa2dmaYKmfcKemWtqZmV%2BpXyYcG5xmmRqhqR6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
