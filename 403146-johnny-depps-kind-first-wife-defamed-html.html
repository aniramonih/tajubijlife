However, she felt what he did was necessary to win the case and supported him as she did when they were a couple.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Who Is Lori Allison, the Woman Johnny Depp Married When He Was 20?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Allison was working as a make-up artist when she married Depp on December 20, 1983. She even did make-up for Depp's band after her sister <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/johnny-depps-first-wife-lori-22930970>introduced</a> them.</p><p class=dh>Depp was 20 while Allison was 25 when the couple tied the knot. However, their marriage lasted only two years before they peacefully parted ways.</p><p class=dh>Depp struggled to land gigs with his band during their time together, but that didn't stop him from earning money. He worked as a telemarketer for a while, selling ballpoint pens, before his wife helped him enter the acting world.</p><p class=dh>Depp met Nicholas Cage through his first wife, which helped him get an audition for "A Nightmare on Elm Street." In his May 2004 Playboy interview, he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://interview.johnnydepp-zone2.com/2004_05Playboy.html>recalled</a> what happened next:</p><p class=dh>"I got the job.

As Depp took on more roles, he started liking his new profession and never looked back.</p><p class=dh>While his career went uphill, his relationship with his wife ended in divorce. After gracefully parting ways with <a class="me a" href=#>Depp</a>, Allison worked with prominent names like Adam Ant and Christina Applegate before her cosmetic brand, "Serendeppity," came into being.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/902a396a207d1b4c1c2100ca46711c95b8f9cc0b6271d4e6b966b90d68e11812.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Johnny Depp performing in Helsinki, Finland on June 19, 2022 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Despite parting ways with one of the best names in Hollywood, Allison maintained a civil relationship with him. She respected his privacy and always had good words to say about him.</p><p class=dh>During her recent interview, Allison shared her views about Depp's defamation case.
