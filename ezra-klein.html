However, the forum did not attract serious attention until March 17, 2009, when an article published on Politico detailed the nature of the forum and the extent of its membership. The Politico article set off debate within the blogosphere over the ethics of participating in JournoList and raised questions about its purpose. The first public excerpt of a discussion within JournoList was posted by Mickey Kaus on his blog on March 26, 2009.</p><p align=justify>He married Annie Lowrey in 2011.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ezra Klein</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ezra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Klein</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Journalist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 9</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1984</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Irvine</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Abel Klein, Jacqueline Klein</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Annie Lowrey</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ezra Klein ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Ezra Klein</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>In 2005 He graduated from the University of California with a degree in political science.</p><p align=justify>The blog he writes on, Wonkblog is ranked as the most read Washington Post blog in 2011.</p><p align=justify>Klein worked on Howard Dean’s primary campaign in Vermont in 2003 and interned for the Washington Monthly in Washington, D.C., in 2004. “The media is as effective and important an agent for change as the legislative bodies, and I think it’s where I’m happiest and most effective,” Klein said. In 2003, he and Markos Moulitsas were two of the earliest bloggers to report from a political convention, that of the California State Democratic Party. In 2006, Klein was one of several writers pseudonymously flamed by The New Republic writer Lee Siegel (posting as a sock puppet called sprezzatura).</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Journalist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In December 2009, Klein wrote an article in The Washington Post, stating that U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman was “willing to cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in order to settle an old electoral score,” because Lieberman “was motivated to oppose health care legislation in part out of resentment at liberals for being defeated in the 2006 Connecticut Democratic Primary.” Klein based his estimate on an Urban Institute report that estimated that 22,000 people died in 2006 because they lacked health insurance. This article was criticized by Jonah Goldberg of the National Review, who called it a “silly claim.” Charles Lane, also of The Washington Post, described Klein’s article as an “outrageous smear.” But E.&nbsp;J. Dionne, also of The Washington Post, agreed with Klein’s claim, saying that “Klein is right that there is not a shred of principle in Lieberman’s opposition.” Klein later said he regretted the phrasing and his position is that despite universal coverage, the social determinants of health are still powerful predictors that, on average, ensure the lower socioeconomic classes die sooner than those with more income and education.</p><p>Klein’s prolific blogging caught the attention of Steve Pearlstein, The Washington Post’s veteran business columnist. “I was blown away by how good he was—how much the kid wrote—on so many subjects,” Pearlstein said. Pearlstein sent samples of Klein’s work to managing editor Raju Narisetti. A few weeks after he heard from Pearlstein, Washington Post foreign correspondent John Pomfret asked Klein to have lunch with him and financial editor Sandy Sugawara. Narisetti hired Klein to be the Post’s first pure blogger on politics and economics. On May 18, 2009, he began writing at the newspaper.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Ezra Klein height</b> Not available right now.

The forum’s membership was controlled by Klein and limited to “several hundred left-leaning bloggers, political reporters, magazine writers, policy wonks and academics.” Posts within JournoList were intended only to be made and read by its members. Klein defended the forum saying that it “[ensures] that folks feel safe giving off-the-cuff analysis and instant reactions.” JournoList member, and Time magazine columnist Joe Klein (no relation to Ezra Klein) added that the off-the-record nature of the forum was necessary because “candor is essential and can only be guaranteed by keeping these conversations private.”</p><p align=justify>On June 25, 2010, Ezra Klein announced in his Washington Post blog that he would be terminating the JournoList group. This decision was instigated by fellow blogger Dave Weigel’s resignation from the Post following the public exposure of several of his JournoList emails about conservative media figures.</p><h2>Who is Ezra Klein Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Ezra Klein</strong> married to <strong>Annie Lowrey </strong>.
