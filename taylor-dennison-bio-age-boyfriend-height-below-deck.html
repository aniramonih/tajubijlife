Finally, on the May 26 episode of the show, Captain Jason Chambers fired away that member and we already seem to have a replacement.

Well, Magda’s work performance had worsened due to constant communication with her ex-boyfriend, Maciek.</p><p>Surprisingly, Captain Jason also fired Chef Ryan McKeown in the next episode (June 2nd) after he had failed to impress the guests with his food for several charters in a row.</p><p>Later on, in the same episode, Taylor Dennison was announced as a replacement third stew, who would be helping out Aesha Scott and Tumi Mhlongo in the vessel.</p><p>Though Taylor may be new to the vessel, she has experience of more than 5 years of working on yachts.</p><p>During her introduction to the show, she revealed that she started working on boats at 18 and mentioned working her “absolute a– off to get to where she is.” “My last boat I finished as head of service on a 115 meter crew of 19, and I’m only 23 years of age.
