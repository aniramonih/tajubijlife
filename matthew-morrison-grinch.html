And though the character is already known for being mean, the actor revealed that he actually based his version of this children's holiday cartoon on an even darker fictional character.&nbsp;According to Morrison, the inspiration behind his version of the Grinch was <strong>Joaquin Phoenix's</strong> Joker. Read on to find out what characteristics Morrison borrowed for his performance, and for more holiday celeb news,&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Reese Witherspoon and Her Daughter Are Twins in Matching Holiday Sweaters</a>.</p><p>Morrison is set to bring the green misanthrope to life in Dr. Seuss' The Grinch Musical, airing Dec. 9 on NBC.&nbsp;But the actor said one the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>biggest challenges of bringing the character to a musical stage</a> was figuring out how to embody the dance moves. After all, he said dancing didn't feel "very Grinch-y."</p><p>"I didn't want the Grinch to be a good dancer," Morrison told Entertainment Weekly. "I took a lot from Joaquin Phoenix's performance in Joker, just going down those steps, like loose and [reveling in] abandon and just carefree and raw. I really felt like that was how the Grinch would dance.&nbsp;At first, I was like 'I don't think the Grinch dances'; it didn't feel very Grinch-y, but then I came up with that and it felt right."<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>And while Morrison has spent many years on Broadway and a large part of his life playing the role of musical-loving glee club director Mr. Schue on Glee, this is actually the actor's <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>first time appearing in a live TV musical</a>.</p><p>"I had entertained [live TV musicals] a little bit, but it wasn't something I was called to or seeking out. But this one really resonated with me," Morrison explained. "They asked me to do it, and I said yes immediately because I think the theater community needs this right nowâ€¦ At this moment in time, with everyone feeling loneliness and isolation, probably a lot of people are feeling a little Grinch-y this year. It was just the right part and the right time."</p><p>Morrison was especially excited to play the Grinch because he says he sees the role as "one of those parts where anything goes," which may explain the left-field Joker inspiration.</p><p>"You can really do anything you want to with this character, and it won't be too big or too over-the-top," Morrison said. "I took some big swings. I don't know if they're going to be great or horrible, but I just went for it, and it felt dangerous and liberating all at the same time."</p><p>Of course, Morrison is not the first actor to take on the role of this holiday-hating character.
