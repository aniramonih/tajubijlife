But once you get on the show and things are starting to be insinuated, from the conversations about 'beards' to me being controlling, it becomes a whirlwind of things," he explained during a February 2021 appearance on <a href=#>The Tamron Hall Show</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>He went on to acknowledge that with the reality show being "all about storyline," he had a feeling the old rumors about him being gay would be brought out on the show. It was 1998 when Stewart first learned of the false claims about his sexuality, via <a href=#>The Players Tribune</a>. So after agreeing to appear on reality TV, Stewart knew "there was a chance that, that [the rumor] may have seeped in."&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the drama, he expressed no regrets for appearing on the show with his ex.&nbsp;"In marriages there's two words â€” there's compromise and sacrifice," he explained. "To be honest with you, if I had to do it again I probably would not do it, but I'm not ashamed of doing it. Because I was really doing it for her because it was her opportunity to be on this stage in which she's on right now." He added how "happy" he is for his reality star ex. Looks like he didn't mind being the "sacrifice" for <a href=#>Porsha's fame</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGtoaYV1e9ahmK2dppq%2FbrTAqaeeppWZerW7jKmmq6uYlnq4tculoJqlo2KyuXnHrqqbmZ6Zeqy70Z2cpaRf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
