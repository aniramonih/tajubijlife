Our body is like the cage, and the spirit is like the bird.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>London continued: “We see that without the cage this bird flies in the world of sleep; therefore, if the cage becomes broken, the bird will continue and exist. Its feelings will be even more powerful, its perceptions greater, and its happiness increased.</p><p>“In truth, from hell it reaches a paradise of delights because for the thankful birds there is no paradise greater than freedom.'”</p><p>London’s comments section was flooded with messages of empathy and support from <a href=# rel=noopener>Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>YG</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Pusha T</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Questlove,</a> LaLa Anthony, Nia Long, Ella Mai and more.</p><p>Nipsey Hussle’s killer, Eric Holder Jr., was <a class=underline-link href=#>sentenced to 60 years to life in prison by a Los Angeles judge</a> in February, eight months after being convicted for gunning down the rapper.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Holder, 33, was allegedly angered by Nipsey accusing him of being a snitch during a brief conversation outside his South L.A. clothing store. He returned moments later with a pair of weapons and unloaded at least 10 shots into the Crenshaw rapper, fatally wounding him.</p><p>Nipsey and Lauren London share a six-year-old son together named Kross, who was born in 2016, roughly three years after the couple started dating.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/11/nipsey-hussles-life-story-being-made-into-docuseries-co-produced-by-lebron-james-250x142.jpg alt="Nipsey Hussle's Life Story Being Made Into Docuseries Co-Produced By LeBron James" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Nipsey Hussle's Life Story Being Made Into Docuseries Co-Produced By LeBron James</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>November 15, 2022</p></a><p>“I also don’t want to give a misconception that I’m at peace and I’m walking around on a cloud,” London told <a href=# rel=noopener>PEOPLE</a> earlier this year while reflecting on her partner’s death.</p><p>“I have to wake up with the intention of this every day because there are days I don’t want to, and I’m like angry about it. And that’s what healing is. It is up and down, side to side, all over the place. You know what I mean? And with each new level, there’s something else.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Meanwhile, a new posthumous Nipsey Hussle verse landed on <a href=# rel=noopener>DJ Drama’s</a>I’m Really Like That album, which debuted on streaming services on Friday.</p><p>The late rapper appears on “Raised Different” alongside Jeezy and Blxst. However, fans of the Victory Lap rhymer might recognize his verse from the Mike & Keys-produced “State of Mind,” which was released in 2016 as part of Nip’s Marathon Mondays&nbsp;series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0miloqijmsZutNSsqqWdXaGutr7Ep2Slp56ZvK9506ugm62kmnqlscCtn2aZnqO2t7HRrJirsQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
