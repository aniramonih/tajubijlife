Girlfriends List, Dating History</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Born Shemar Franklin Moore in Oakland, California, USA on 20 April 1970 under the zodiac sign of Taurus, the handsome bachelor is a former fashion model and actor, who came to prominence for starring in the role of Malcolm Winters in “The Young and the Restless”, playing Derek Morgan in “Criminal Minds”, and portraying Daniel ‘Hondo’ Harrelson in “S.W.A.T.” Thanks to his accomplishments in the world of acting, Moore has won eight NAACP Image Awards as well as a Daytime Emmy Award.</p><p>Shemar Moore certainly became known as one of the most handsome actors in Hollywood. Ever since he made his debut, his good-looking appearance has caused enormous interest of the female part of audiences for his supposed private life.</p><p>Over the years, it hasn’t diminished at all, since he’s dated many famous ladies who couldn’t remain indifferent to his great physique and charming personality.</p><p>We did a little research about his dating history and compiled you want we think is a complete list of the beautiful ladies Shemar Moore has been romantically linked to. Just keep listening ‘til the end, and you will find out more!</p><p>Before his career took off, Shemar Moore apparently hooked up with actress Sanaa Lathan back in February 1985, at the age of 15 – Sanaa was 14. After dating for more than four years, the couple reportedly took a step further and became engaged in September 1989, and tied the knot at a small wedding ceremony held on 11 May 1990. However, Shemar and Sanaa eventually parted ways, with their divorce finalized on 15 July 1996.</p><p>In the meantime, between 1993 and 1994 the handsome actor was allegedly romantically linked in a relationship with actress Bobbie Phillips. Little is known about their romance, except that it didn’t last long.</p><p>In November 1994, Shemar Moore fell in love with famous R&B singer-songwriter Toni Braxton, after featuring as her love interest in the music video for her song “How Many Ways”. They immediately hit it off, becoming, as he explained in his 2013 interview with <a rel=nofollow href=#>BET</a>, his “first Hollywood relationship.”</p><p>He recalled the time he won the role in her music video, saying “I was a baby. I didn’t know s**t. I had just graduated from college, I had no money, and I was on ‘Young and the Restless.’ She called my agent when she was shooting a video in Miami, and it just went from there.”</p><p>He also described their relationship as “a wild ride” and continued, “I was like the little kid who found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.” Shemar also revealed, “She would never sing for me, though. That always bothered me.” After dating for more than six months, the supposedly hot Hollywood couple decided to part ways in May 1995.</p><p>Following his split from Toni Braxton, “The Young and the Restless” star went on to date actress Lela Rochon in May 1996. The couple even made a red carpet appearance at the Fifth Annual MTV Movie Awards, which took place in Burbank, California in June of the same year, but then called it quits later that month.</p><p>In 1997, Shemar Moore became romantically involved in a relationship with Academy Award-winning actress Halle Berry. He would later admit in his 2013 interview with <a rel=nofollow href=#>BET</a> that she was the first woman to really knock his socks off, saying “I fell hard for Halle”.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This event has been a long time coming, and I’m so thrilled to finally share it with you. <a rel=nofollow href=#>#WellnessWarriorthon</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>#WorldDiabetesDay</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>https://t.co/W3wLvS6EE8</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/zbeyAM1vuc</a></p><p>— Halle Berry (@halleberry) <a rel=nofollow href=#>November 10, 2020</a></p><p>The “Criminal Minds” star also explained that the two of them had to keep their romance a secret since “she was fresh off her divorce from David Justice.”</p><p>Shemar continued, “I’m still grateful for that relationship. I was smitten not just because of who she was, but because we were so similar in so many ways. She was bi-racial; she was kind of going through the same things I was in Hollywood.” He described their romance as “a necessary experience” and added, “It made me much stronger as a man, and knowing the caliber of woman I want in the future.” The duo broke up in 1998, although the former lovers remained on good terms.</p><p>In 2000, Shemar Moore dated Canadian actress Sharlene Royer. They went public with their relationship after locking lips during a red carpet appearance at The 6th Annual Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards in Santa Monica, California in September of the same year.</p><p>However, the public isn’t aware of how long they lasted as a couple – obviously not very long, given lack of any further appearances.</p><p>In October 2002, the handsome actor totally charmed his “Birds of Prey” co-star Ashley Scott. Little is known about their relationship since they managed to keep it under the wraps, however, it’s known that it lasted for about a year, since they broke up in September 2003.</p><p>Shemar Moore and Kimberly Elise fell for each other while filming the 2005 romantic comedy-drama “Diary of a Mad Black Woman”. They reportedly dated from July 2004 to October 2005. In her <a rel=nofollow href=#>February 2019 blog post</a>, Kimberly recalled the time they co-starred on the film, and revealed that Shemar “was a perfect gentleman and an excellent actor.” adding, “I was a bit nervous about the romantic story line, because I had not really done one before, and Shemar was pro at it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shemar-moore-is-seen-partying-on-the-beach-on-july-6-2014-news-photo-1594844498-745x1024.jpg><p>Unfortunately, she didn’t share any details about their relationship behind the scene.</p><p>In 2006, Shemar dated famous TV presenter and model Gabrielle Richens, stepping out publicly for the first time at the People’s Choice Awards in Los Angeles, California in January 2006. It was also the last time they were spotted together, so their relationship was obviously short-lived, especially as later that year the famous actor reportedly had an encounter with his “The Young and the Restless” co-star Victoria Rowell, but how long they were an item remains a mystery too.</p><p>Thereafter, the “S.W.A.T.” star put a spell on Swiss actress, model and beauty queen Lauriane Gilliéron, initially known for being crowned Miss Switzerland 2005. They met each other at the Independent Television Festival Opening Night Gala, at Raleigh Studios in Los Angeles, in July 2007.</p><p>In no time, they became romantically involved in a relationship, Lauriane confirming their romance to the Swiss publication, <a rel=nofollow href=#>SonntagsBlick</a>, saying “I’ve found a good man and I’m very happy”, adding that he was an unknown actor.</p><p>Even though they kept their romance low-profile, the two were spotted holding hands in public, however, their relationship ended the same year, although reasons for their split remain unknown, but following their break-up, the ex-Miss Switzerland told the publication, “We had a wonderful time together!”, and in one of his recent interviews, Shemar described her as a beautiful and sweet girl. So, we hope that they remained on good terms after the split.</p><p>According to <a rel=nofollow href=#>Blast</a> magazine, Shemar Moore and Instagram star Lauren Wood were an item back in 2014. She accompanied him at two events during the month of July, making their red-carpet debut at the 2014 ESPY Awards, which was followed by their appearance at the 2014 Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour. However, after that the two weren’t pictured in public, which presumably meant that their romance ended.</p><p>Shemar Moore started dating professional soccer player Shawna Gordon sometime in 2014 – they confirmed their relationship after being stopped by <a rel=nofollow href=#>TMZ</a> crew in January 2015. When one of the reporters approached their car and asked Moore which female athlete had the best body in sport, he replied, “My girlfriend Shawna Gordon, because she’s a professional soccer player,” and added, “If she stands up and turns around you might just faint.” He referred to her as “#1 HOTTEST chick in pro sports”.</p><p>During the following month, Shemar brought her on to “<a rel=nofollow href=#>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>”, telling Ellen that Shawn was someone who made him smile and challenged him. He also recalled what his grandmother told him once, saying, “She’s up there smiling at me, she said I told you, I told you, when you least expect it, she’s going to show up and bite you on the tush.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Again, this romance didn’t last very long, and the last time the couple was spotted in public was in July 2016, when they attended an Arsenal Football (soccer) Club event in Los Angeles. An insider told <a rel=nofollow href=#>Hollywood Life</a> magazine that the two “looked to be happy and in love”. The insider added, “They walked through the crowded event, and stopped periodically to share a joke, sneak in a kiss and take pictures with fans. Shemar kept his arm around Shawna all night and kept her right by his side.” However, shortly afterwards, the couple went their separate ways.</p><h2>Kiss with Phaedra Parks</h2><p>According to <a rel=nofollow href=#>E! News</a> magazine, the “Criminal Minds” star met TV personality Phaedra Parks for the first time when filming an episode of Andy Cohen’s show “Watch What Happens Live” in December 2016, during which they got flirty and even locked lips.</p><p>The following morning, Parks told <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Daily Dish</a> magazine, “I’m newly single, and while I had a wonderful kiss with Shemar Moore — a few kisses with Shemar Moore — such a treat for my lips, but I am single and if it happens, it happens.”</p><p>During the following month, Phaedra was asked by Cohen if she was dating anyone, to which she replied, “Well, you hooked me up with somebody and we chat now and then.” The host then asked her if she wanted to date Shemar Moore and she said, “We’ll see.” So, the rumors continued swirling around that they’d became a couple.</p><p>In November 2017, she promoted Moore’s latest project, the series “S.W.A.T.” by uploading <a rel=nofollow href=#>a throwback photo of herself kissing his</a> neck and referring to him as her “bae” in the caption, which just heated up the rumors. Just a few days before that, Moore also denied their romance during his appearance on <a rel=nofollow href=#>E! News’ “Daily Pop” show</a>, saying, “I met Phaedra doing a nighttime talk show with Andy Cohen and Andy Cohen does this thing late at night and he likes to get you to drink.</p><p>And so you’re loose and you have fun on his show,” but adding, “We played and we flirted and we got our little kissy face on. And then that went viral and that’s the first and the last time that I’ve ever seen or met Phaedra.” Shemar then uploaded <a rel=nofollow href=#>an Instagram video</a> of himself explaining where the photo came from, and shutting down those rumors. He said, “Phaedra Parks – met her one time at a talk show, a year ago. Flirted with her, kissed on her, drinked with her, at the talk show. Took pictures with her at the talk show. Ain’t dating somebody I don’t know. I don’t watch reality TV.”</p><p>Over the years, Shemar Moore became pretty close to his “Criminal Minds” co-star Kirsten Vangsness. The interesting fact is that their characters were romantically involved on-screen, while they sparked the dating rumors by locking their lips on red carpets from time to time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shemar-moore-rex-gallery-06-682x1024.jpg><p>However, they were nothing more than friends off-screen – Kirsten even admitted in her 2011 interview with <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Advocate</a> magazine that she realized she was a lesbian after flirting with him back in 2005. She said, “We got along famously and he was flirting with me and I remember thinking, I must be queer. I should be reacting differently to what he’s doing.”</p><p>In January 2018, Shemar Moore became romantically involved in a relationship with Cuban-born American actress Anabelle Acosta, known for starring as Natalie Vasquez in “Quantico”. During the following month, Shemar opened up about their relationship during <a rel=nofollow href=#>his appearance on Steve Harvey’s show</a>, sharing that he was the one who spotted Anabelle: “There was a young lady that I had eyes on” and admitted that he “looked her up, watched some interviews and auditions of her”, so he “got a sense of her vibe”.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shemar Moore Says Grammy Date Anabelle Acosta Should Squash Gay Rumors <a rel=nofollow href=#>https://t.co/KR50bqi8e0</a></p><p>— TMZ (@TMZ) <a rel=nofollow href=#>January 30, 2018</a></p><p>Shemar then admitted that he challenged everybody at his job to bring him Anabelle’s email, so he could ask her out. He told Steve that an email led to their first meeting, actually a red-carpet appearance at the 2018 Grammy Awards.</p><p>Shortly afterwards they started dating, although deciding to take it slow. He explained, “She said to me, ‘Whatever the attraction is, the interest is there, but let’s work on being friends… Let’s get to know each other. Let’s vibe it out. Let’s not speed through it because you are cute, I am cute. We’re taking our time.” Well, if they did become a couple, by January 2019 they were no longer.</p><p>Since then, Shemar has apparently remained unattached. Recently, he told <a rel=nofollow href=#>Watch! Magazine</a>, “‘I want to be a father, I want to have a partner in crime, a woman to share my life with. I want to continue to evolve, I want to continue to take the next step in my life.”</p><p>We hope he will find the right one in the near future, but given his short-and-sharp dating history, we’re not holding our breath!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZlpuuqr7PqKqtZpOkunDDx6hkoZmjYsCpscyaqWaln6S%2FpnnDmquenF2ctrO4xaugnqaUqHqttdKtZJ2ZpJ67qHnHoqqtp6KufA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
